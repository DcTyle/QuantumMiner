# 2 CANONICAL EVOLUTION RULE -- NON-INTERPRETIVE CONSTRAINT SYSTEM

**This rule is mandatory and overrides all other phrasing in this document.**

EigenWare defines exactly one admissible form of system evolution.

All dynamic behavior is expressed as a deterministic generation of a *candidate next state*,
followed by a single acceptance predicate.

```
candidate_next_state = evolve_state(current_state, inputs, ctx)

if accept_state(current_state, candidate_next_state, ledger_delta, ctx):
    commit_state(candidate_next_state)
else:
    commit_state(sink_state)
```

```

### Match 2: `Document` (Eq L1-L13)

```text

## 2.1 ASCII naming rules (mandatory)

- ASCII only. No Greek letters or math glyphs.
- Variables use lower_snake_case.
- Operators (callable functions) use lower_snake_case and MUST appear in the Operator Registry below.
- One name has one meaning. No overloading.

## 2.2 Core variable registry (global)

- current_state: The committed state at the start of a tick.
- candidate_next_state: The next state produced by evolve_state(...) before acceptance.
- inputs: External inputs for the tick (UE adapter, sensors, pulses). May be empty.
- ctx: Immutable context for the tick (constants, limits, configuration).
- ledger_delta: Proposed conserved-quantity deltas implied by candidate_next_state.
- sink_state: Deterministic non-projecting / dark state used when accept_state(...) fails.

## 2.3 Identity-space variables (6D-9D subspace)

- phase: Phase orientation coordinate (wrapped, radians or bounded fixed-point units (per-axis scaling; no global uniform normalization)).
- coherence: Coherence strength in [0, 1]. High coherence means tight identity-shell coupling.
- memory: Temporal persistence / correlation coordinate in [0, 1].
- flux: Environment coupling scalar (field / flow / dispersion input channel).
- nexus: Reality-ledger coordinate used to select the active projection ledger.

## 2.4 Operator registry (canonical)

All operators are deterministic and MUST be pure functions unless explicitly marked as committing state.

- evolve_state(current_state, inputs, ctx) -> candidate_next_state
  Produces a candidate next state for the tick.

- compute_ledger_delta(current_state, candidate_next_state, ctx) -> ledger_delta
  Computes conserved-quantity deltas implied by the candidate.

- accept_state(current_state, candidate_next_state, ledger_delta, ctx) -> bool
  Returns True if and only if all invariants, conservation, causality, and tolerance predicates pass.

- commit_state(next_state) -> None
  Commits the provided state as the new current_state.

- make_sink_state(current_state, ctx) -> sink_state
  Produces the deterministic sink_state for this tick. No randomness.

- reality_label(nexus, ctx) -> int
  Returns the discretized reality ledger label for the provided nexus coordinate.

- is_reality_shift(prev_nexus, next_nexus, ctx) -> bool
  Returns True if reality_label(prev_nexus) != reality_label(next_nexus).

## 2.5 Auxiliary operator registry (math and encoding)

**This rule is mandatory and overrides all other phrasing in this document.**

EigenWare defines exactly one admissible form of system evolution.

All dynamic behavior is expressed as a deterministic generation of a *candidate next state*,
followed by a single acceptance predicate.

```
candidate_next_state = evolve_state(current_state, inputs, ctx)

if accept_state(current_state, candidate_next_state, ledger_delta, ctx):
    commit_state(candidate_next_state)
else:
    commit_state(sink_state)
```

There are:
- no alternative behaviors,
- no conditional interpretations,
- no recovery paths,
- no partial acceptance,
- no error-handling logic.

Any candidate evolution that fails acceptance **must collapse deterministically**
to the sink (null / non-projecting / dark) state.

Any text that implies optionality, interpretation, correction, adjustment,
or multiple valid outcomes is invalid under this rule.


---

NOTE: All equations in this file are to be interpreted strictly as candidate next-state generators only. Conservation, causality, and ledger relations act solely as acceptance predicates. Failure of acceptance collapses evolution to the sink state.

# 3 GPU Envelope, Pulse Encoding, Text Injection, and Causality Preservation (Final-Spec Draft)

### 3.2.1 Pulse sampling at pulse-delta time (tau_delta) and phase-anchor extraction

This subsection makes explicit the order-of-operations that is implied by the canonical spec prose:

Order of operations (per impulse interval k):
1. Define impulse boundary times t_k (GPU envelope tick boundaries) and the fixed sample offset tau_delta.
2. Sample pulse observables at t_k_plus = t_k + tau_delta:
   - A_k = pulse amplitude / envelope measure at t_k_plus
   - V_k = pulse voltage (or RMS proxy) at t_k_plus
   - f_k = local carrier frequency estimate over a short window around t_k_plus
3. Derive the phase anchor (phase offset) theta_anchor_k deterministically from the sampled amplitude (and only optional auxiliary terms if allowed by the current canonical mode).
4. Evolve phase deterministically over the interval [t_k, t_{k+1}) using:
   - the base phase-step (suit/value or other symbolic primitive),
   - plus coupling from delta/ratio fields (dlnA, dlnf) as defined below.
5. Compute phase deltas and (if required) derived time deltas only when coherence gating passes.

Canonical anchor equation (ASCII-safe):
```text

# Primary (strict) form: phase anchor derived from amplitude at pulse-delta time
theta_anchor_k = wrap_turns( theta_ref_turns
                             + alpha_A * ln( A_k / A_ref ) )

# Optional extended form (only if explicitly enabled by canonical authority)
theta_anchor_k = wrap_turns( theta_ref_turns
                             + alpha_A * ln( A_k / A_ref )
                             + alpha_V * ln( abs(V_k) / V_ref )
                             + alpha_f * ln( f_k / f_ref ) )
```

Note on "time":
- This system does NOT expand or compress time as an input.
- Orientation shifts occur via phase-density (amplitude-delta) mechanisms.
- Time deltas (dt_star) are an output derived from coherent phase offsets, not an externally imposed dilation:
```text
dphi_coh_turns = wrap_turns( phi_obs_turns - phi_ref_turns )
omega_eff_turns_per_sec = omega0_turns_per_sec * (1 + kappa_rho * rho_phi)

dt_star_sec = dphi_coh_turns / omega_eff_turns_per_sec

# dt_star is only computed if coherence >= C_min.
```

## 3.3 Text -> phase: how ASCII becomes phase offsets (storage substrate)

### 3.3.1 Symbol-phase primitives: "cyberspace" rings, phase bins, and optional frequency identity

This subsection formalizes the primitive discussed in chat:
- The primitive substrate is a set of phase-recognizable symbols (ASCII, audio symbols, file tokens, etc).
- Each symbol has a stable identity as a phase bin (and optionally a frequency bin).
- "Cyberspace" is the ring-indexed manifold where these primitives live as relative phase objects.
- Trajectories are generated by deterministic evolution + delta/ratio coupling (no free inputs).

Primitive mapping (canonical, deterministic):
```text

# Symbol -> phase bin (turns) (bijective where required)
theta_sym_turns(sym) = sym_index(sym) / N_sym

# Optional: Symbol -> frequency bin (for "frequency identity" of a symbol)
f_sym_hz(sym) = f_ref_hz * H_sym(sym)   # H_sym is a quantized harmonic multiplier or bin id

# Phasor seed (radius is amplitude; angle is phase)
z_sym = A_ref * exp(i * 2*pi*theta_sym_turns(sym))
```

Ring representation (NOT a spiral):
```text

# Rings are indexed by n. Each ring has an orientation anchor theta_start_turns[n].

# The ring anchor shifts by a delta-derived phase-density value (PAF_n).
theta_start_turns[n+1] = wrap_turns( theta_end_turns[n] + PAF_turns[n] )

# Orientation shift is a phase reference update, not time compression.
```

Super-compressed storage rule (primitive-friendly):
```text

# Store symbols (or suit/value) plus delta/ratio fields; reconstruct by deterministic wrap + cumulative sums.

# Never treat raw absolute values as identity primitives unless stored as sparse anchors.
```

## 3.4 9D delta formation: embedding, projection, and the collapse rule

## 3.5 Spider graph encoding: 9D -> frequency and amplitude (pulse synthesis)

Canonical: Developers/analysis/NeuralisDevSpecCanonical.md L50-L59

Canonical equation extract (sanitized):
```text
1.5 Spider graph encoding: 9D -> frequency and amplitude (pulse synthesis)
Logically, the spider graph defines nine fixed radial axes (one per dimension). Each axis has a normalization function (so di is bounded) and a weight (so some axes contribute more strongly). The mapping produces:
    -    a scalar "frequency" value: this is the signed aggregate of the weighted per-axis scaled delta components (no global uniform normalization), clamped to a safe range; it functions like the phase-advance coefficient.
```

No calculations folder material is mapped to this canonical subsection in this consolidation pass.

### 3.5.1 Delta/ratio coupling: amplitude-frequency deltas drive phase-density orientation and ring-to-ring starts

This subsection makes explicit the "delta-only" compression and evolution mechanism:

Delta/ratio fields (compression-friendly):
```text

# Use ratio deltas to avoid scale ambiguity and improve determinism under per-axis scaling bounds (no global uniform normalization).
dlnA_t = ln( A_{t+1} / A_t )
dlnf_t = ln( f_{t+1} / f_t )

# Deterministic quantization (required for stable rehydration)
dlnAq_t = Q(dlnA_t)
dlnfq_t = Q(dlnf_t)
```

Phase advance inside an interval (impulse-to-impulse evolution):
```text

# Base phase-step from symbolic primitive (e.g., suit/value mapping)
dtheta_base_turns(t) = phi_suit_turns(suit_t) + step_turns(value_t)

# NOTE: Optional "cards" (suit/value) visualization primitive for phase evolution

# Canonical: Developers/analysis/NeuralisDevSpecCanonical.md L111-L130 (wrap + shortest signed distance in turns)

# Canonical: Developers/analysis/NeuralisDevSpecCanonical.md L1170-L1185 (theta_byte_turns / theta_sym_turns primitives)

# Canonical: Developers/analysis/NeuralisDevSpecCanonical.md L2020-L2048 (dtheta_sym_turns and theta(t+1) wrap rule)
#

# This file uses phi_suit_turns(...) + step_turns(...) as shorthand for a symbolic primitive.

# The canonical implementation primitive is "symbol -> theta_sym_turns" and "delta(theta_sym)".

# If you want a human-visual "deck-of-cards" model (N_sym=52), define it deterministically as:

```text

# 4 Fixed suit order (deterministic): hearts=0, diamonds=1, clubs=2, spades=3
suit_id(suit) in {0,1,2,3}

# 5 Fixed value order (deterministic): ace=0,2=1,...,10=9,jack=10,queen=11,king=12
value_id(value) in {0..12}

# 6 Suit encodes the phase-plane (quadrant) as an offset in turns
phi_suit_turns(suit) = suit_id(suit) / 4

# 7 Value encodes the intra-plane evolution coordinate; this keeps the map bijective over 52 symbols
step_turns(value) = value_id(value) / 52

# 8 Absolute primitive phase (turns) for the card/symbol at time t
theta_prim_turns(t) = wrap_turns( phi_suit_turns(suit_t) + step_turns(value_t) )

# 9 Base phase-step is the *difference* between successive primitive phases (wrap-safe)
dtheta_base_turns(t) = wrap_turns( theta_prim_turns(t) - theta_prim_turns(t-1) )
```

# Relation to "delta(c*pi)" phrasing (turns form, ASCII-safe)

# 1 turn = 2*pi radians, so pi radians = 0.5 turns. If you want a value-step scaled by c*pi:
```text

# 10 Choose a deterministic rational c_rank (default example: c_rank = 1/13)
c_rank = p/q    # fixed at build-time for a given profile

# 11 Then c*pi radians corresponds to (c_rank * 0.5) turns per unit rank delta.
c_pi_turns_per_rank = 0.5 * c_rank

# 12 Rank-delta phase-step (wrap-safe)
dtheta_rank_turns(t) = wrap_turns( c_pi_turns_per_rank * ( value_id(value_t) - value_id(value_{t-1}) ) )
```

# Identity by offset-rotation (conceptual primitive; used when comparing trajectories)

# "Rotate all possible evolution offsets to determine identity" can be implemented as:
```text

# 13 Offset grid is deterministic (example): offsets are multiples of 1/N_sym turns.
offset_grid = { m / N_sym : m in Z }  # evaluated over a bounded window for speed

# 14 Choose the offset that maximizes alignment / minimizes wrapped distance to a target anchor/basis phase:
delta_hat_turns = argmin_{delta in offset_grid} abs( wrap_turns( (theta_candidate_turns + delta) - theta_basis_turns ) )
```

# Coupled evolution (amplitude/frequency deltas modulate the phase clock)
theta_{t+1}_turns = wrap_turns( theta_t_turns
                               + dtheta_base_turns(t)
                               + kappa_A * dlnAq_t
                               + kappa_f * dlnfq_t )
```

Ring-to-ring start primitive (PAF derived purely from amplitude deltas):
```text

# PAF_n uses only amplitude delta content from ring n (no suit dependence inside PAF_n).
PAF_turns[n] = Q( sum_{t in ring n} g(dlnAq_t) )

theta_start_turns[n+1] = wrap_turns( theta_end_turns[n] + PAF_turns[n] )
```

Coherence gating (no phase/time inference when incoherent):
```text
if coherence < C_min:
    # do not compute dt_star or identity deltas; route to deterministic non-projecting branch if specified
    dt_star = UNDEFINED
```

## 14.1 How "GPU pulses" become simulation injection (kernel evolution step)

Canonical: Developers/analysis/NeuralisDevSpecCanonical.md L60-L65

Canonical equation extract (sanitized):
No explicit standalone equations are defined in this canonical subsection (beyond definitions and prose).

No calculations folder material is mapped to this canonical subsection in this consolidation pass.

### 14.1.1 Injection step: how anchors + coupled evolution enter the kernel without violating closure

This subsection clarifies the injection semantics:
- GPU-derived pulse terms are treated as measured constraints for phase-density enforcement.
- They do not inject "free energy" or arbitrary new interactions.
- They enforce entropy/conservation by selecting an orientation and limiting evolution to the allowed delta/ratio manifold.

Kernel update (conceptual, order-aligned):
```text

# At impulse boundary k:
theta_0_turns = theta_anchor_k

# Within [t_k, t_{k+1}):
for each tick t:
    theta_{t+1}_turns = wrap_turns( theta_t_turns
                                   + dtheta_base_turns(t)
                                   + kappa_A * dlnAq_t
                                   + kappa_f * dlnfq_t )

# Outputs:

# - phase deltas between impulse intervals

# - ring orientation shift via PAF_n (if ring aggregation is enabled)
```

Derived time delta (output-only) from coherent phase offset:
```text

# When coherence is valid, time offset is inferred from phase offset and omega_eff.
dt_star_sec = dphi_coh_turns / omega_eff_turns_per_sec
```

## 14.2 Causality and closed-system guarantees (why injection doesn't violate closure)

Canonical equation extract (sanitized):
No explicit standalone equations are defined in this canonical subsection (beyond definitions and prose).

## 14.3 How qubit density scales with pulses, tiers, and bands (and why it doesn't explode)

Canonical: Developers/analysis/NeuralisDevSpecCanonical.md L74-L83

Canonical equation extract (sanitized):
No explicit standalone equations are defined in this canonical subsection (beyond definitions and prose).

Calculation consolidations mapped to this canonical subsection:

Source calculation: Qbit prediction calculations.md
Calc: Developers/calculations/Qbit prediction calculations.md L1-L112

Order of operations (consolidated):
1. Encode a predicted phase delta for each qubit lane from recent observed drift.
2. Apply correction via phase update U = exp(-i*delta_phi_pred*sigma_z/2).
3. Update confidence and lane weights based on observed error residuals.
4. Constrain updates with deterministic clamping and fixed-point quantization.

Equation block (sanitized, verbatim where possible):
```text

# NOTE: CANONICAL SPEC

# The authoritative specification for implementation is:

# `Developers/NerualisDevSpecCanonical.md`

# All other spec files are secondary and may only be consulted for topics

# not explicitly covered in the canonical spec.

Perfect. Let's extend our verified DMT-observer-effect framework to a qubit lattice in a quantum computer. We'll go step by step, showing mathematically how temporal-spatial coherence and higher-dimensional modulation affect qubit states, gates, and entanglement.

# CANONICAL EVOLUTION RULE -- NON-INTERPRETIVE CONSTRAINT SYSTEM

**This rule is mandatory and overrides all other phrasing in this document.**

EigenWare defines exactly one admissible form of system evolution.

All dynamic behavior is expressed as a deterministic generation of a *candidate next state*,
followed by a single acceptance predicate.

```
candidate_next_state = evolve_state(current_state, inputs, ctx)

if accept_state(current_state, candidate_next_state, ledger_delta, ctx):
    commit_state(candidate_next_state)
else:
    commit_state(sink_state)
```

There are:
- no alternative behaviors,
- no conditional interpretations,
- no recovery paths,
- no partial acceptance,
- no error-handling logic.

Any candidate evolution that fails acceptance **must collapse deterministically**
to the sink (null / non-projecting / dark) state.

Any text that implies optionality, interpretation, correction, adjustment,
or multiple valid outcomes is invalid under this rule.


---

NOTE: All execution stages must implement the candidate -> accept_state -> commit_state/sink pipeline. Error handling, recovery, or optional branches are forbidden.

## Spec context excerpts (EigenWareSpec_v51.md)

### Match 1: `before` (Spec L606-L630)

```text
```
Everything below this line is intentionally outside the Sections 1-3 Verification Snapshot.
It is retained for reference but must not be treated as part of Sections 1-3 canonical scope.

4.1.1 Profile identity and intended use

Profile name: P_SUM_CTX
Use case: lower-tier -> higher-tier summary pulses (context activation / macro-structure reinforcement)
Key property: broader coupling than the core evolution profile; harmonic weights decay more slowly so higher harmonics retain influence and propagate resonance across a wider band neighborhood.

4.1.2 Quantization and fixed-point domains (locked)

See: Match 3: `Locked` (Spec L604-L628) (canonical description).


Rounding rule (locked): "round half up" implemented in integer arithmetic; never use platform float rounding for canonical state.
```

# 16 Operator Definitions
API anchors are phase-triggered external interface operators. They NEVER perform
I/O directly. Instead, they emit deterministic dispatch tokens consumed by the
external interface layer.

Each API Anchor A_api_k contains:
- Activation surface Sigma_api_k in phase space
- Deterministic projection observable ?_api_k
- Dispatch descriptor D_api_k
- Constraint-preserving rule

Activation:
A_api_k ACTIVE ? ? in Sigma_api_k

Execution:
If ACTIVE -> EMIT D_api_k
Else -> No operation

---

## 17.5 Aggregate file displacement

Given a file F with codepoints cp_i for i = 1..N:

Let:

A = Sigma_{i=1..N} E9(cp_i)

Define:

S_F = (1 / ||A||) * Sigma_{i=1..N} E9(cp_i)

Where ||A|| is the Euclidean norm of A.

This definition removes order ambiguity.

Canonical C++ form:

```cpp
inline double e9_norm(const E9& a) {
    double s = 0.0;
    for (int i = 0; i < 9; ++i) s += a.v[i] * a.v[i];
    return sqrt(s);
}

inline E9 e9_add(const E9& a, const E9& b) {
    E9 out{};
    for (int i = 0; i < 9; ++i) out.v[i] = a.v[i] + b.v[i];
    return out;
}

inline E9 e9_scale(const E9& a, double s) {
    E9 out{};
    for (int i = 0; i < 9; ++i) out.v[i] = a.v[i] * s;
    return out;
}

See: Ω.1.2 Aggregate file displacement (canonical description).


## Omega.2 Operator Definitions

### Omega.2.1 Operator formal structure

Define an operator:

O: R^9 -> R^9

Operators must satisfy the canonical update:

S_out = Pi_G(S_in + T(S_in))

Where:
- T is a geometric transform
- Pi_G is a constrained projection under the carrier metric

Canonical C++ form:

```cpp
struct PhaseOperator {
    E9 (*transform)(const E9&);
};
```

### Omega.2.2 Coherence-weighted projection

Define:

P(a,b) = Sigma_{i=0..8} a_i b_i w_i

Where:

w_i = 1 for i != 5
w_5 = |S_5|

This formalizes coherence-weighted interaction.

Canonical C++ form:

```cpp
inline double P_coherence_weighted(const E9& a, const E9& b) {
    double sum = 0.0;
    for (int i = 0; i < 9; ++i) {
        const double wi = (i == 5) ? fabs(a.v[5]) : 1.0;
        sum += a.v[i] * b.v[i] * wi;
    }
    return sum;
}
```

## Omega.3 Carrier Metric Tensor

### Omega.3.1 Metric tensor G

Define carrier metric tensor:

G = diag(g_0, g_1, ..., g_8)

Default is identity unless specified.

### Omega.3.2 Deviation energy and constraint

Deviation energy:

E_dev = DeltaS^T G DeltaS

Constraint:

E_dev <= epsilon

If violated:

DeltaS_corrected = DeltaS * sqrt(epsilon / E_dev)

This removes ambiguity in stabilization.

Canonical C++ form:

```cpp
struct G9 {
    double g[9]; // diagonal entries
};

inline G9 G9_identity() {
    G9 out{};
    for (int i = 0; i < 9; ++i) out.g[i] = 1.0;
    return out;
}

inline double deviation_energy(const dE9& d, const G9& G) {
    double e = 0.0;
    for (int i = 0; i < 9; ++i) e += d.d.v[i] * G.g[i] * d.d.v[i];
    return e;
}

inline E9 correct_delta_if_needed(const dE9& d, const G9& G, double epsilon) {
    const double Edev = deviation_energy(d, G);
    if (Edev <= epsilon || Edev == 0.0) return d.d;
    const double s = sqrt(epsilon / Edev);
    return e9_scale(d.d, s);
}
```

## Omega.4 Constrained Projection Operator Pi_G

### Omega.4.1 Canonical definition

Pi_G(S) =
- S, if E_dev <= epsilon
- S * sqrt(epsilon / E_dev), otherwise

This definition replaces vague "normalize" language.

Canonical C++ form:

```cpp
inline E9 Pi_G(const E9& S_in, const E9& S_ref, const G9& G, double epsilon) {
    // DeltaS defined against a reference point S_ref (typically the current state)
    dE9 d = make_delta(S_in, S_ref, /*wc=*/S_in.v[5]);
    const E9 d_corr = correct_delta_if_needed(d, G, epsilon);
    return e9_add(S_ref, d_corr);
}
```

## Omega.5 Operator Chaining

### Omega.5.1 Coherence traversal rule

Given ordered operators O_1, O_2, ..., O_n:

S_{k+1} = Pi_G(O_k(S_k))

No scalar passing allowed.

Explicit closure: Operators communicate exclusively through manifold geometry.

Canonical C++ form:

```cpp
inline E9 apply_operator_chain(const E9& S0,
                              const PhaseOperator* ops,
                              size_t n_ops,
                              const G9& G,
                              double epsilon) {
    E9 S = S0;
    for (size_t k = 0; k < n_ops; ++k) {
        const E9 Sout_raw = ops[k].transform(S);
        S = Pi_G(Sout_raw, S, G, epsilon);
    }
    return S;
}
```

## Omega.6 Observable Extraction

### Omega.6.1 Scalar projection rule

Define observable extraction:

phi = P(S_final, B_observable)

Where B_observable is a fixed basis vector.

Canonical C++ form:

```cpp
inline double observable_phi(const E9& S_final, const E9& B_observable) {
    return P_coherence_weighted(S_final, B_observable);
}
```

## Omega.7 Effective Constant Closure

### Omega.7.1 Effective constant via projection

Instead of K_eff = K0 * m, define:

K_eff = P(S_context, B_K)

Context defines effective value geometrically.

Canonical C++ form:

```cpp
inline double K_eff_from_context(const E9& S_context, const E9& B_K) {
    return P_coherence_weighted(S_context, B_K);
}
```

## Omega.8 Collapse Rule

### Omega.8.1 Omega_sink definition

If stabilization fails repeatedly:

S -> 0

Or project into designated dark-state subspace:

S = (0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0)

Canonical C++ form:

```cpp
inline E9 Omega_sink() {
    E9 z{};
    for (int i = 0; i < 9; ++i) z.v[i] = 0.0;
    return z;
}
```

## Omega.9 Determinism Clause

### Omega.9.1 Deterministic requirement

For identical input files and operator order, the manifold state MUST be bitwise identical across executions on identical hardware.

Normative closure: This requirement applies to embedding (sin/cos), aggregation, operator transforms, metric projection, chaining, and observable extraction.

# Appendix ? -- Emergent Bounce Lighting via Lattice Flux (v51)

## ?.1 Flux-Lattice Radiative Structure

### 6D Flux

dE/dt = grad ? S + alpha f(P6) + Sigma_i eta_i FL_i

### 8D Aether Lattice

dphi/dt + v ? gradphi = Sigma_i alpha_i f_i(P_i)

Where:

- FL = Fluxons (energy carriers)
- AE = Aether lattice (propagation medium)
- CO = Coherons (phase alignment stability)

Light is defined as a propagating oscillatory flux solution across the lattice manifold.

---

## ?.2 Bounce Lighting Conditions

Bounce lighting requires:

1. Energy transport
2. Surface interaction
3. Re-emission with modified phase/amplitude

Define lattice response:

E_out = R(theta, L, lambda) ? E_in

Where:

- R = lattice response operator
- L = lattice factor
- lambda = leakage / absorption
- theta = incident phase relation

Surface behavior is modeled as local lattice density variation.

Reflection = impedance mismatch in lattice  
Absorption = energy transfer into local lattice degrees of freedom  
Bounce = re-propagated flux solution  

No ray tracing required if lattice evolution is solved directly.

---

## ?.3 Wave Transport Condition

d2E/dt2 = c2 grad2E ? ?E

Where:

- c = propagation constant derived from manifold projection
- ? = damping term from leakage and coherence loss

Wave solutions generate:

- Direct lighting (first propagation)
- Secondary bounce (subsequent propagation)
- Global illumination (steady-state solution)

---

## ?.4 Engine Approximation Comparison

Unreal Engine vs Manifold Evolution:

Ray tracing            -> Field evolution  
Lumen GI               -> Flux propagation  
Reflection probes      -> Lattice density response  
Lightmaps              -> Steady-state wave solution  

Unreal approximates transport that lattice evolution would simulate directly.

---

## ?.5 Energy Retention Constraint

For realistic bounce:

0 < R < 1

R = 0 -> no bounce  
R = 1 -> infinite mirror  
0 < R < 1 -> realistic indirect lighting  

Energy must persist beyond first interaction.

---

## ?.6 Computational Constraint

Emergent bounce requires solving discretized wave equation in real time.

Performance feasibility depends on:

- Lattice resolution
- Time-step stability
- GPU acceleration strategy

This appendix defines bounce lighting as a consequence of wave-based lattice transport,
not as a separate rendering system.


---

# Appendix ? -- 9D -> 3D Force Tensor Projection (v51)

## ?.1 Canonical Projection Operator

Define manifold state:

S = (D0, D1, D2, D3, D4, D5, D6, D7, D8)

Define projection tensor T_{i\mu}(S):

F_i = ?_{mu=0}^{8} T_{i\mu}(S) * D_mu

Where:
i in {0,1,2} (3D spatial indices)
mu in {0..8} (manifold dimensions)

This defines a deterministic mapping:

F : R^9 -> R^3

No ad-hoc scalar amplification permitted.

---

## ?.2 Canonical Deterministic Tensor Form

Projection SHALL derive from intrinsic manifold quantities only.

Define:

F = -grad(D6) + D4 * v_hat + D7 * v

Where:

- D6 = curvature dimension
- D4 = flux dimension
- D7 = doppler dimension
- v_hat = normalized spatial velocity
- v = spatial velocity vector

Curvature produces gradient forces.
Flux produces pressure-like outward coupling.
Doppler modifies velocity coupling.

---

## ?.3 Effective Mass Projection

Acceleration SHALL be derived from projected effective mass.

a = F / m_eff

Where:

m_eff = sqrt(D4^2 + D6^2 + epsilon)

Effective mass MUST be derived from manifold energy quantities.
No fixed scalar mass constants permitted unless explicitly anchored.

---

## ?.4 Mechanical Integration Rule

Discrete update per commit_state window:

v_{t+1} = v_t + a * dt
x_{t+1} = x_t + v_{t+1} * dt

dt MUST be sourced from canonical tick latch operator.
No independent time scaling permitted.

---

## ?.5 Determinism Clause

Given identical manifold state S and identical dt,
Force and acceleration outputs MUST be identical across executions.

No stochastic sampling permitted within force projection layer.


---

# Appendix ? -- Deterministic Radiance Projection (MGFT Bridge) (v51)

## ?.1 Radiance as Observable Projection

Let S(x) = (D0..D8) be the manifold state.

Radiance is defined as:

L(x) = Pi(S(x))

Where Pi is a deterministic projection operator from R^9 to observable radiance.

Light SHALL be treated as an observable of manifold state,
not as an independent system.

---

## ?.2 Temporal Brightness Factor

gamma_t(x) = 1 + |D3(x)| / (mean(|D3|) + epsilon)

No fixed temporal constant permitted.
All normalization MUST derive from current manifold statistics.

---

## ?.3 Coherence Interference Factor

I_c(x) = clamp(|D5(x)|, 0, 1)

f_interference(x) = 1 / (epsilon + I_c(x))

Coherence SHALL act as amplitude gate for radiance.

---

## ?.4 Energy Density Definition

rho_E(x) = (D4(x)^2 + D6(x)^2) / (mean(D4^2 + D6^2) + epsilon)

Flux and curvature jointly define radiative energy density.

---

## ?.5 Doppler Spectral Observable

k_D(x) = D7(x) / (mean(|D7|) + epsilon)

Renderer color mapping MUST derive solely from k_D(x).

---

## ?.6 Canonical Radiance Law

L(x) = rho_E(x) * gamma_t(x) * I_c(x)

No arbitrary multipliers permitted.

---

## ?.7 Radiance Field Structure

Per-voxel outputs SHALL include:

Channel 0: L(x) intensity
Channel 1: k_D(x) doppler shift
Channel 2: rho_E(x) energy density
Channel 3: I_c(x) coherence

This field SHALL be renderer-agnostic.

---

## ?.8 Radiative Flow Advection

Define derived flow:

v(x) = -grad(D6(x))

rho_E and L MAY be advected along v(x).

This produces structured transport without artificial lighting models.

## Appendix Z - Consolidated Legacy Content

This appendix consolidates legacy content that existed in earlier document versions and is retained for completeness.
Content is included once here to avoid duplication while preserving all prior context.

### CANONICAL EVOLUTION RULE — NON-INTERPRETIVE CONSTRAINT SYSTEM

# CANONICAL EVOLUTION RULE — NON-INTERPRETIVE CONSTRAINT SYSTEM

**This rule is mandatory and overrides all other phrasing in this document.**

EigenWare defines exactly one admissible form of system evolution.

All dynamic behavior is expressed as a deterministic generation of a *candidate next state*,
followed by a single acceptance predicate.

```
candidate_next_state = evolve(current_state, inputs, ctx)

if accept(current_state, candidate_next_state, ledger_delta, ctx):
    commit(candidate_next_state)
else:
    commit(sink_state)
```

There are:
- no alternative behaviors,
- no conditional interpretations,
- no recovery paths,
- no partial acceptance,
- no error-handling logic.

Any candidate evolution that fails acceptance **must collapse deterministically**
to the sink (null / non-projecting / dark) state.

Any text that implies optionality, interpretation, correction, adjustment,
or multiple valid outcomes is invalid under this rule.


---

NOTE: All execution stages must implement the candidate → accept → commit/sink pipeline. Error handling, recovery, or optional branches are forbidden.

### Match 4: `Trace` (Spec L476-L500)

```text
A dominant-mode transition occurs when:

transition_mode = ( k_star(t) != k_star(t+1) )

Commit emission gate (event-driven):

transition_event = transition_phi OR transition_mode

If transition_event is false for all lanes/neural_objects in a commit window, the engine MAY
choose to emit:
- no telemetry updates, or
- only aggregate scalars (e.g., coherence), or
- only budget/control traces (strict replay mode).

If transition_event is true for any lane/neural_object, the engine MAY emit:
- the minimal delta set required to represent the transition (eigen coefficient deltas preferred),
- plus required control traces for replay.

Eigen-trajectory compounding (the "many actions in one pulse" mechanism):

In an eigen/diagonal update form, each eigen component advances by an integrated phase:

c_k(t+1) = c_k(t) * exp(-i * omega_k * d_tau)

This is a single deterministic operator application per commit boundary, but it may represent

A dominant-mode transition occurs when:

transition_mode = ( k_star(t) != k_star(t+1) )

Commit emission gate (event-driven):

transition_event = transition_phi OR transition_mode

If transition_event is false for all lanes/neural_objects in a commit window, the engine MAY
choose to emit:
- no telemetry updates, or
- only aggregate scalars (e.g., coherence), or
- only budget/control traces (strict replay mode).

If transition_event is true for any lane/neural_object, the engine MAY emit:
- the minimal delta set required to represent the transition (eigen coefficient deltas preferred),
- plus required control traces for replay.

Eigen-trajectory compounding (the "many actions in one pulse" mechanism):

In an eigen/diagonal update form, each eigen component advances by an integrated phase:

c_k(t+1) = c_k(t) * exp(-i * omega_k * d_tau)

## 19.1 V31-S1. Canonical implementation artifacts

# 20 V31-S1. Canonical implementation artifacts

For v51, the following are the **single canonical sources** for runtime behavior and must be treated as normative implementation definitions, not examples:

- Data layout canon:
  - `ew_types.h` (all structs, field names, byte layout)

- Invariant canon (fail-closed):
  - `ew_invariants.h` (violation codes, halt conditions)

- Ingress canon (binary-framed ingress only):
  - `ew_ingress.h` (`PulsePacketV1` validation)

- Operator canon (phase transport):
  - `ew_phase_transport.h` (`ew_phase_transport_dtheta_u64`)

- Constraint microcode canon (phase-binary eq page):
  - `ew_eq_pages.h` (opcode enum)
  - `ew_eq_exec.h` (packing, coord_sig mapping, execution)

- Boot-freeze substrate build canon:
  - `ew_substrate_microprocessor.h/.cpp` (construct immutable carrier anchors)

```

### V31-A. Canonical file map for executable implementation

## V31-A. Canonical file map for executable implementation

These source files are the canonical implementation targets for the runtime loop and must be treated as the **single source of truth** for their respective roles:


- CUDA backend (device):
  - `cuda_backend/src/ew_cuda_backend.cu` (GPU tick kernel and projection)

- Verification harness:
  - `runtime_cli/` (CMake CLI to run deterministic ticks and emit visible verification output)

---

### V31-B. Boot-freeze and one-way coupling (carrier → runtime)

## V31-B. Boot-freeze and one-way coupling (carrier → runtime)

V31 enforces the blueprint invariant:

1) **Carrier anchor space is immutable after boot-freeze.**
   - Implemented by building `std::vector<AnchorDefV1> anchors_def_` once in `ew::EigenWareRuntime::boot_or_throw()`.
   - A deterministic coord_sig `anchors_def_sig_u64_ = FNV-1a(anchors_def bytes)` is stored.

2) **Runtime phase space is mutable and GPU-driven.**
   - Implemented by `std::vector<AnchorRuntimeV1> anchors_rt_`.
   - Only ancilla/runtime fields mutate (`phase_u64`, `coherence_u64`, `mass_q63_u64`, `last_leak_q63_u64`, `dark_mass_q63_u64`, `violation_mask_u64`).

3) **No runtime value may write back into carrier anchor space.**
   - Enforced by:
     - coord_sig verification on every tick: `fnv1a64_bytes(anchors_def_) == anchors_def_sig_u64_`.
     - Any mismatch halts runtime with violation code `VC_ANCHOR_MUTATION` (fail-closed).

---

### V31-C. Deterministic runtime dispatcher loop (host reference)

## V31-C. Deterministic runtime dispatcher loop (host reference)

The canonical host reference loop is `ew::EigenWareRuntime::tick_or_throw()` in `ew_runtime.cpp`:

- Step 0: Verify immutability and ingress validity.
  - `ew_verify_anchor_defs_or_throw()` ensures `anchors_def_` has not changed.
  - `ew_validate_pulse_or_halt()` enforces binary-framed ingress (`PulsePacketV1` only).

- Step 1: Obtain dispatcher scalars from the **meta/dispatcher anchor**.
  - `anchors_def_[0].cf.basis_u64[0..3]` encodes:
    - `[0] grad_limit` (power-of-two ⇒ `grad_mask = grad_limit - 1`)
    - `[2] dispatch_div` (update cadence)
    - `[3] projection_div` (projection cadence)

- Step 2: For each anchor, compute phase-transport delta `dθ`.
  - Implemented by `ew_phase_transport_dtheta_u64(def, pulse, anchor_index, grad_mask)`.

- Step 3: Update runtime coherence (ancilla) and execute constraint microcode page.
  - `rt.coherence_u64 = mix(rt.coherence_u64 ^ dθ ^ pulse.seq_u64 ^ def.fp.semantic_mask_u64)`
  - `ew_eq_exec_cf_basis(def, rt, dθ, &last_violation_code_, &run_flag_)` executes packed instructions stored in immutable anchor basis slots.

- Step 4: Projection (visible verification artifact).
  - `ApiKVDictMapV1` is filled with `key_id_u64 = def.fp.anchor_id_u64` and `value_q63 = (phase_u64 & 0x7FFF...FFF)`.
  - UE visualization uses this map to render a deterministic texture and ensure the simulation is visibly evolving.

### Ω.1.1 Canonical codepoint → 9D embedding

### Ω.1.1 Canonical codepoint → 9D embedding

Let cp be a Unicode codepoint (0 ≤ cp ≤ 0x10FFFF).

Define:

n = cp / 0x10FFFF

Then define the embedding E9(cp) as:

E9(cp) = (
  sin(2πn),
  cos(2πn),
  sin(4πn),
  cos(4πn),
  sin(8πn),
  cos(8πn),
  sin(16πn),
  cos(16πn),
  n
)

Explicitly:
- No tokenization layer exists.
- Entire file is aggregated.

Canonical C++ form:

```cpp
inline E9 embed_codepoint_to_E9(uint32_t cp) {
    const double n = (double)cp / (double)0x10FFFF;
    const double two_pi = 6.283185307179586476925286766559;

    E9 out{};
    out.v[0] = sin( 1.0 * two_pi * n);
    out.v[1] = cos( 1.0 * two_pi * n);
    out.v[2] = sin( 2.0 * two_pi * n);
    out.v[3] = cos( 2.0 * two_pi * n);
    out.v[4] = sin( 4.0 * two_pi * n);
    out.v[5] = cos( 4.0 * two_pi * n);
    out.v[6] = sin( 8.0 * two_pi * n);
    out.v[7] = cos( 8.0 * two_pi * n);
    out.v[8] = n;
    return out;
}
```

Determinism closure note (normative): the mathematical definition above is canonical. Implementations SHALL ensure bitwise-identical results on identical hardware for identical inputs by using a single canonical sin/cos evaluation strategy (e.g., a build-time generated lookup table of IEEE-754 double outputs for the required phases, embedded as immutable data, or an equivalently fixed algorithm with fixed rounding and no fast-math).

### Ω.1.2 Aggregate file displacement

### Ω.1.2 Aggregate file displacement

Given a file F with codepoints cp_i for i = 1..N:

Let:

A = Σ_{i=1..N} E9(cp_i)

Define:

S_F = (1 / ||A||) * Σ_{i=1..N} E9(cp_i)

Where ||A|| is the Euclidean norm of A.

This definition removes order ambiguity.

Canonical C++ form:

```cpp
inline double e9_norm(const E9& a) {
    double s = 0.0;
    for (int i = 0; i < 9; ++i) s += a.v[i] * a.v[i];
    return sqrt(s);
}

inline E9 e9_add(const E9& a, const E9& b) {
    E9 out{};
    for (int i = 0; i < 9; ++i) out.v[i] = a.v[i] + b.v[i];
    return out;
}

inline E9 e9_scale(const E9& a, double s) {
    E9 out{};
    for (int i = 0; i < 9; ++i) out.v[i] = a.v[i] * s;
    return out;
}

// 'cps' is the file represented as a sequence of Unicode codepoints.
inline E9 aggregate_file_to_state(const uint32_t* cps, size_t N) {
    E9 A{};
    for (size_t i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
        A = e9_add(A, embed_codepoint_to_E9(cps[i]));
    }
    const double nrm = e9_norm(A);
    if (nrm == 0.0) return A; // defined edge-case: empty or all-zero aggregate
    return e9_scale(A, 1.0 / nrm);
}
```

# V52 SURGICAL PATCH (APPEND-ONLY) — Anchor-Only Constraint Law + Verification Contract

This section is an append-only surgical patch to v51. It adds missing hard guardrails and an executable verification contract derived from the most recent implementation discipline. It does NOT alter any v51 text; it only appends enforceable definitions.

## A. Anchor-Only Constraint Law (AOCL)

A.1 Definition
AOCL is a non-negotiable invariant:

- All simulation constraints, geometric data, manifold coupling, bounds, stability envelopes, and any parameter that can change runtime behavior MUST be encoded in immutable anchors.
- Runtime code MUST NOT define, derive, tune, or “infer” any behavior-shaping constraint or geometry parameter.
- Runtime code is an actuator only: it may apply anchor-provided coefficients/bases/matrices/tensors to mutable ancilla states and perform deterministic accept/commit/sink enforcement.

A.2 What counts as a “behavior-shaping parameter”
A behavior-shaping parameter is ANY constant, table, coefficient, normalization factor, weighting, clamp threshold, coupling term, geometry basis, projection basis, acceptance bound, or scaling term such that changing it changes the evolution trajectory or accept/sink decision for the same initial state.

Under AOCL:
- If changing a number in code changes evolution, that number is illegal in code and MUST be moved into anchors.
- Code may only contain math primitives (add/mul/shift/clamp) with no domain meaning.

A.3 Allowed runtime computations
Runtime MAY:
- Load anchors, validate format, freeze anchors (read-only post-freeze).
- Allocate ancilla (mutable state holders).
- Apply anchor-defined transforms to ancilla.
- Enforce acceptance predicates and sink routing exactly as defined by anchors.
- Emit telemetry and verification artifacts.
Runtime MUST NOT:
- Introduce new constraints or geometry not present in anchors.
- Hard-code coupling coefficients, weights, denominators, or projection tuning values.
- Perform “auto-fit,” “auto-calibration,” or dynamic parameter learning in the actuator layer.

A.4 Enforcement rule (must be testable)
Any artifact that claims compliance with AOCL MUST satisfy:
- A static scan of runtime source code reveals no behavior-shaping numeric constants except:
  - Fixed-point scaling exponents (e.g., q16_16 shift count)
  - Array sizes and compile-time layout constants (e.g., dimension=9)
- All other numeric values are loaded from anchors and logged with their anchor revision ID.

## B. Runtime Verification Contract (RVC)

B.1 Purpose
RVC makes the substrate falsifiable. Every run MUST produce observable artifacts that prove:
- A 9D lattice state evolved under anchors
- Object references were stored in the substrate (lanes/particles) as memory IDs
- Determinism is satisfied (replay yields identical results)

B.2 Required outputs (per run)
A compliant runtime MUST emit:

1) run.log (human-readable)
- width, height (lattice size)
- steps, seed (run controls)
- anchor_revision_id (or anchor coord_sig)
- accepted (0/1)
- statesig9_u64x9 (or equivalent deterministic coord_sig)
- sink_reason (only if accepted=0)

2) state.json (machine-readable summary)
- same run metadata as run.log
- object_counts: map of object_id to count in lattice
- total_energy (or energy ledger summary)
- optional: per-dimension stats (min/max/mean) for x0..x8

3) lattice projection image
- lattice_x0x1.ppm (or png) showing a deterministic projection of evolved 9D state
- Projection MUST be defined by anchors or by a non-behavior-shaping visualization rule (e.g., plot density of x0,x1). If visualization uses thresholds/scales, those must be anchor-provided under AOCL.

4) object reference image
- object_map.ppm (or png) visualizing object_id distribution across the lattice.
- Color mapping MUST be deterministic and documented.

B.3 Determinism requirement (falsification test)
Given identical:
- anchors (exact bytes)
- initial ancilla state (or deterministic init seed)
- run controls (width, height, steps, seed)
The runtime MUST produce identical:
- statesig9_u64x9
- run.log/state.json values (except timestamps, if present)
- identical image bytes OR identical image coord_sig

B.4 Acceptance / sink falsification requirement
RVC requires an explicit accept/sink predicate:
- Candidate state is produced
- Acceptance predicate is evaluated
- If accepted: commit candidate
- If rejected: route to sink state (non-projecting) and stop or continue in sink, as specified by anchors

The predicate MUST be fully determined by anchors (bounds, conservation ledger, stability).
The sink state MUST be defined and deterministic.

## C. Object Memory Reference Operator (OMRO)

C.1 Definition
Objects are not embedded in runtime as mutable structures. They are immutable memory entries referenced by particles/lanes via IDs. Particles hold references, not copies.

C.2 Required fields
Each object memory entry MUST define, at minimum:
- object_id_u64 (unique)
- label_ascii (optional human label)
- mass_or_cost_q32_32 (for energy debit/creation)
- geomsig9_u64x9 (immutable geometry coord_sig)
- phase_seed_u64 (deterministically derived from label and/or geometry coord_sig)

C.3 Operator: object_import_request
Inputs:
- target_lane_id (or selection rule defined by anchors)
- object_id_u64
- scalar_context (energy_budget, mode flags)
- ancilla_state
- anchors

Outputs:
- updated ancilla_state (object_id reference updated in the lane)
- energy ledger debit
- accept/reject decision

Rules (AOCL-compliant):
- Energy debit MUST be anchor-defined: E_req = f(object_cost, context, anchors)
- If debit violates conservation bounds → reject import (no partial creation)
- If accepted: lane stores object_id_u64 and phase_seed_u64 and any anchor-defined meta

C.4 Operator: object_reference_influence
Particles referencing objects MUST influence phase dynamics only through anchor-permitted channels, e.g.:
- theta offset bounded by anchor-defined scale
- coupling modulation bounded by anchor-defined mask

Runtime may not invent influence functions; influence must be anchor-specified.

## D. UE / External Engine Integration Rule (Adapter-Only)

D.1 Adapter-only constraint
Unreal/Unity integrations are consumers/producers of framed ingress/egress packets ONLY.
They MUST NOT define physics or constraints.
They may:
- visualize projections
- request object imports/exports
- stream telemetry
They may not:
- alter anchors
- introduce new constraint parameters
- “correct” the simulation by local engine physics

D.2 Boot/shutdown coupling
If boot/shutdown is tied to opening a project:
- The project must reference a single canonical substrate anchor set (immutable after load)
- The same anchors must produce the “same AI substrate” deterministically unless a new anchor revision is explicitly selected

## E. Implementation Compliance Checklist (for every runtime build)

E.1 AOCL compliance
- [ ] No behavior-shaping constants in code
- [ ] All constraints/geometry loaded from anchors
- [ ] Anchor freeze after load; runtime cannot write anchors
- [ ] Accept/sink predicate uses only anchor-provided bounds

E.2 RVC compliance
- [ ] run.log emitted
- [ ] state.json emitted
- [ ] lattice projection image emitted
- [ ] object reference image emitted
- [ ] deterministic state coord_sig emitted and stable under replay

E.3 OMRO compliance
- [ ] particles store object_id references (not object copies)
- [ ] import/export uses energy debit and accept/reject under anchors
- [ ] object influence bounded and anchor-defined

# V2 SURGICAL PATCH APPENDIX (v1 → v2)
Date: 2026-02-13

This appendix is **append-only**. All original v1 text above remains byte-for-byte unchanged.
Where this appendix conflicts with earlier wording, **this appendix controls**.

## A. Terminology and Mechanism Overrides (Global)

### A.1 No tokenization / no crypto coord_sig
EigenWare v2 SHALL NOT use:
- tokenization, token streams, word tokens, caption tokens, token IDs
- coordinate-coord_sig coord_sig (sha*, COORD9_SIG_U64, etc.) for determinism, identity, or bookkeeping

EigenWare v2 SHALL use:
- **9D coordinate signatures** (Sig9) for identity
- **basis9-labeled events** (Event9) for serialized event payloads
- **byte-for-byte equality** for determinism verification

### A.2 Canonical identity
All identity and bookkeeping MUST be addressed through:
- `Sig9 := (d1,d2,d3,d4,d5,d6,d7,d8,d9)` with fixed-point encoding per project standard.
- `Epoch9 := (tau_epoch, segment_id, trial_index)` when time indexing is required.

No other identity mechanism is allowed.

### A.3 Serialization operator renames (surgical override)
If any v1 section references token-based serialization, treat the following as the canonical v2 interface:

- `serialize_basis9_state(state_obj, sig9, epoch9) -> bytes`
- `deserialize_basis9_state(bytes_in, sig9, epoch9) -> state_obj`

Event payloads MUST be encoded as **Event9 records** (not token lists):
- `Event9 := (sig9, epoch9, event_code_u16, payload_bytes, payload_len_u16)`

### A.4 Determinism contract (no coord_sig)
A run is deterministic iff identical inputs yield identical outputs **byte-for-byte**.

Optional non-coordinate-coord_sig run summary for logs:
- `RunSummary := (run_sig9, epoch9_end, output_byte_len, last_state_sig9)`

## B. Bell Emulation Mode Runtime Flow (9D Ledger Replay)

This section defines the runtime pipeline for Bell-test emulation using the NIST timetag format.

### B.1 Inputs
- Alice raw event stream: sequence of `RawEvent(channel_u64, timetag_u64, transfer_count_u64)`
- Bob raw event stream: same schema
- Environment constants: `timetag_bin_seconds`
- Window parameters: latch windows and detection windows (in timetag bins)
- Slot parameters: `window_start_bins`, `slot_period_bins`, `slot_count=16`

### B.2 Processing pipeline
1) Build per-side sync arrays:
   - Extract all events where `channel==6` and store their timetags in order: `sync_time_A[k]`, `sync_time_B[k]`.

2) For each trial index k (paired by analysis policy; default is min(lenA,lenB)):
   - Compute `setting_A[k] := extract_setting(sync_time_A[k], rng_events_A, latch_window_A)`
   - Compute `setting_B[k] := extract_setting(sync_time_B[k], rng_events_B, latch_window_B)`
   - Compute `A_mask[k] := extract_click_mask(sync_time_A[k], click_events_A, detect_window_A, slot_params_A)`
   - Compute `B_mask[k] := extract_click_mask(sync_time_B[k], click_events_B, detect_window_B, slot_params_B)`
   - Emit `BellTrialRecord(k, setting_A, setting_B, A_mask, B_mask, sync_time_A, sync_time_B, aux_flags)`.

3) Replay / emulation:
   - The 9D ledger simulation MUST be able to advance one trial per BellTrialRecord without referencing raw timetags.

### B.3 Outputs
Mandatory outputs:
- Deterministic BellTrialRecord stream (byte-identical under identical inputs)
- Ledger closure report per trial (E_total constant; E_res updated deterministically)

Optional outputs (analysis-only):
- Correlation summaries derived from BellTrialRecord (settings vs click masks)
- Invalid-state statistics (INVALID_BOTH / INVALID_NONE rates)

### B.4 Fast-path encoding guidance
For engine acceleration:
- Pack settings into 4 bits: (2 bits for Alice, 2 bits for Bob).
- Store click masks as fixed 16-bit words.
- Delta-code sync times if stored (optional; replay does not require absolute time).

This is designed to minimize per-trial compute while preserving falsifiability.
---

## V3 SURGICAL PATCH APPENDIX (AUTHORITATIVE)

Normative rule: This appendix overrides any ambiguous or conflicting execution descriptions above. No cryptography; all identity and bookkeeping use 9D coordinate signatures.

### B1. Kernel signature enforcement

Allowed:
K(anchor_projection_ro, runtime_state_rw, tau) -> runtime_state_rw

Forbidden:
K(runtime_state) -> anchor

### B2. Ingress is bounded + deduplicated (non-blocking)

Ingress uses a bounded SPSC ring buffer as the only path into tick execution.

Derived bounds:
- ring_cap = 1 << ceil_log2(num_lanes)
- max_payload_bytes = 8 * ring_cap

Normative reject:
- payload_bytes > max_payload_bytes
- coord_sig repeats within last ring_cap inserts

### B3. Deterministic reduction order (GPU)

All reductions must use fixed index order (deterministic tree), not atomics:
- REDUCE_SUM_Q63_DET(x,n)
- REDUCE_MAXABS_Q63_DET(x,n)

2.3.1 Emergent Coherence (Derived Observable; Non-Storage)

Coherence is NOT a stored variable. It is an emergent observable computed from relative
interaction, amplitude-driven Hilbert dilation, and phase-angle dispersion.

Canonical coherence observable (integer dispersion proxy; Blueprint APPENDIX AG):
Given a set of phase positions {theta_u64_i} sampled across active lanes/neural_objects at a tick boundary:

Interpretation:
- R_u64 near 0 indicates phase alignment (low dispersion).
- Larger R_u64 indicates phase dispersion (decoherence pressure).
This coherence observable is a telemetry quantity and MAY be used for admissibility predicates and stabilization decisions,
never as a stored memory state.

Harness requirements (integer-only):
- If all theta_u64_i are equal, R_u64 MUST be 0.

5.4 Electronic signaling and execution: what is direct, what is derived

The ingestion pipeline uses the GPU's electrical switching directly as the execution substrate. The "persistent resonance of webpage data" is formed because the pulse-driven updates are realized in the kernel and accumulate into stable attractors under deterministic evolution. We do not claim we are measuring analog electrical frequencies from the GPU. The "electronic signaling" is the physical implementation of the pulse integrator: kernels execute, switching occurs, and state advances. That is the directness: the encoding and ingestion are performed as in-GPU electrical execution, not as a heavyweight CPU text pipeline.

See: Match 2: `Sequences` (Spec L1154-L1178) (canonical description).


5.5 Crawler observation model (what it extracts, and why)

The crawler does not attempt to perfectly store a page. It extracts features that support stable resonance formation: repeated terms, consistent framing, and link-based context continuity. This matches your continuum concept: persistent coherence over time and across sources is what becomes memory.

5.6 Encoder mapping rules (explicit, no mysticism)

The encoder turns crawler observations into three kinds of pulse candidates:

Type A - Lexical/term excitation pulses (word/band activation)
If a term already has a known attractor (existing eid), the encoder emits a single activation pulse targeting that eid using the language/context profile and broader harmonic coupling. This is "a word in one pulse" via resonance activation, not via resending letters.

Rounding rule (locked): "round half up" implemented in integer arithmetic; never use platform float rounding for canonical state.


Fair. If the numbers aren't derived, they don't belong in the spec.

The right fix is: the spec should not hardcode weights as "chosen." It should define a deterministic derivation procedure that (a) produces weights from measurable quantities and (b) freezes them per snapshot/version so replay stays exact.

Below is a drop-in replacement for Section 4.1.3-4.1.4 that shows the work and removes arbitrary constants. It derives weights from a single objective: "tier-summary pulses should maximize contextual retrievability (coherence persistence + binding stability) per unit update budget, while minimizing clamp/violation risk."

SECTION 4.1.3 - Weight Derivation for P_SUM_CTX (No Arbitrary Numbers)

P_SUM_CTX weights are derived, not chosen. The derivation is performed during a calibration pass on a fixed training slice (or the initial crawl corpus segment) and then frozen as part of the snapshot. Once frozen, the weights are constants for deterministic replay.

We define a tier-summary objective J that encodes what this tier is for:

J = E[ ?chi_band ] + E[ ?cont_band ] ? lambda_violation * E[ V ] ? lambda_clamp * E[ C ] ? lambda_budget * E[ B ]

# A.12 PART I -- Original Hardened Runnable Blueprint

# A.13 EigenWare GPU Firmware AI -- Full Blueprint Specification (2025-2026)

EigenWare is a persistent, phase-evolution-based simulation kernel designed to execute inside a long-running CUDA kernel (or equivalent accelerator runtime). The system ingests pulse-like observables, evolves a closed-system-like 9D manifold, enforces coherence gating, performs tiered sparse commits, and supports text/symbol injection via phase seeding.

This document is a **firmware-level blueprint**, not production code. It preserves the original structure, scope, and detail of the prior specification while normalizing all mathematics and semantics to a single consistent framework:

- Phase is the sole state authority.
- Time is a field defined over a 9D manifold.
- Amplitude represents the tensor gradient of that time field.
- Phase propagates at invariant speed **c** and is never accelerated.
- Apparent dilation arises from metric path length, not clock-rate scaling.
- Phase resolution is geometrically derived and hardware-bounded.

No sections, subsystems, or conceptual domains have been removed; incorrect interpretations have been re-expressed in place.

- The profile registry mapping extractors to allowed profiles.
- The persistent SCENE_* band promotion rule that converts repeated emergent joins into typed scene bands.
- The dual audio band promotion logic (pitch vs event) and their binding into scenes.

These pieces make the ingestion substrate complete: every file type maps into streams, every stream maps into pulses, and creativity becomes a natural consequence of constraint-rich compression rather than a bolt-on feature.

SECTION 7 - High-Value Public Corpora and Domain Packs (for Crawler Ingestion)

This section defines "Domain Packs": curated, registry-addressable sets of sources that can be scheduled, sampled, and versioned. The point is not to chase the entire web, but to ingest the same kinds of public corpora that have historically produced strong general intelligence in language, code, image understanding, audio understanding, and physical-constraint intuition.

A Domain Pack is defined by: domain_pack_id, domain_id list, trust_class defaults, acquisition mode (dump/API/static files), sampling policy, provenance rules, and a manifest of expected file types. Packs are versioned and reproducible. Packs must be runnable offline once artifacts are acquired (strict replay).

7.1 What we mean by "confirmed", "documented", and "common"

For modern commercial models, exact training datasets are often not fully disclosed. This spec therefore separates three categories:

EigenWare should prioritize Confirmed and Common, and treat Documented as optional until validated.

?5 = wrap_turns( theta_byte_turns(b) ? theta_carrier )

where wrap_turns yields the shortest signed distance in [-0.5, 0.5) turns. The carrier phase is a transient local state for the formation event, not a durable lifetime object.

Carrier update rule (deterministic, per formation stream):
theta_carrier ? wrap01(theta_carrier + carrier_step * ?5)

5.11.4 Word formation: from bytes to a word-attractor candidate

A word token w is a byte sequence b1..bn. The encoder creates a formation stream that is a sequence of candidate pulses applied to a designated formation-target band. This target is not "a new anchor created immediately." It is a temporary projection target that may collapse into an existing band or may be promoted into a new attractor only after continuum evidence.

Formation stream procedure (per word instance):
	1.	Select a projection target:

	-	If w matches an existing attractor coord_sig above projection tolerance, target that attractor immediately and skip formation (one-pulse activation path).
	-	Otherwise target a "formation staging band" keyed by a deterministic coord_sig bucket of w (so repeated novel occurrences collide deterministically into the same staging region without exploding ids).

	2.	For each byte bj in w:

	-	Compute ?5 from theta_byte_turns(bj) relative to theta_carrier (5.11.3).
	-	Construct a Basis9 delta with:
	-	dominant phase term: ?5

1.1 Description

EigenWare operates as a closed, phase-evolving system in which amplitude represents the
tensor gradient of time and phase evolution is constrained by relativistic dilation.

Amplitude modulates the effective circumference of Hilbert space. As amplitude increases
(e.g., as particle velocity approaches c), the admissible phase manifold contracts, producing
time dilation. Observed density and gravitational effects arise from phase packing density,
not intrinsic mass.

Particles are excitations within a 9D manifold represented across three axioms.
Quasiparticles are excitations spanning three or more axioms.

Phase angle is defined geometrically and derived from measured kernel impulses, not inferred
from symbolic clocks or abstract frequencies.

# EigenWare Blueprint v51 -- Phase Resolution and Hardware Bounds

Bundle generation: 2026-02-11T04:19:55Z

## Phase Resolution and Hardware Bounds

Phase resolution is **not chosen arbitrarily**. It is derived geometrically and bounded by silicon.

Let:
- ell(r) be the metric radial depth in Hilbert/state space (indexed by amplitude),
- C(ell) be the circumference of the phase manifold at that depth,
- c be the invariant propagation speed.

The theoretical number of distinct phase states per turn is:

N_theta(ell) = C(ell) / c^2

Silicon imposes minimum and maximum representable amplitudes:
- A_min, A_max -> ell_min, ell_max

Thus:

N_theta,min = C(ell_min) / c^2  
N_theta,max = C(ell_max) / c^2

The firmware uses a **fixed-point phase ring** sized as the smallest power-of-two envelope that contains N_theta,max. This envelope is a representation constraint, not a physical assumption. Shallower metric depths occupy subranges of the ring.

- time as relative (tick time),
- amplitude as time dilation factor,
- phase as the sole state variable,
- kernel pulses as signal generators,
- and the prohibition of absolute clocks.

All subsequent sections depend on these definitions.

1.3 Derivable Calculations and Authorities

Authority source for phase deltas:
- delta_theta_fp SHALL be derived from kernel-observed impulse cadence (pulse edge count / cycle deltas) via a deterministic
  integer or LUT-based mapping owned by /core/scheduler/pulse_scheduler.cpp.
- The mapping MUST be replay-stable (same inputs -> same outputs) across platforms.

Phase accumulation (wrap-by-overflow, canonical):
- theta_u64_next = theta_u64 + (uint64_t)delta_theta_i64
- dtheta_i64     = (int64_t)(theta_u64_next - theta_u64)   // two's-complement subtraction yields minimal-arc signed delta

```

### Match 3: `Bounds` (Spec L2249-L2273)

```text
Your canonical Basis9 axis order is:

d1-d3 are spatial/embedding axes (the manifold's spatial projection; implementation-defined), d4 is the temporal axis (tick/frame reference), and d5-d9 are the phase-space axes: d5 coherence phase axis Theta_p (stored, in turns), d6 flux, d7 phantom, d8 aether, d9 nexus. In other words, Basis9 is split into a 3D spatial projection plus a temporal coordinate plus a 5D phase space.

This is the corrected axis table (the one you highlighted earlier, fixed to your axioms). "Main writers" here means which subsystem is allowed to mutate the coordinate in canonical paths; the encoder may propose deltas, but commit_state is always via the same deterministic evolution boundary.

Axis	Canonical name	Canonical domain	Operational meaning in EigenWare	Main writers (canonical)	What it influences
d1-d3	basis9_spatial	implementation-defined, quantized	3D projection / spatial embedding for locality and visualization; can be a true XYZ projection or a manifold embedding	evolution + constraint mapping	neighborhood selection, local interaction neighborhoods
d4	basis9_temporal	integer tick (tau_q)	causal ordering coordinate; commit_state barriers and tier ordering are expressed against this	scheduler + tier protocol	causality gates, "same timeline" interaction rule
d5	basis9_phase_coherence (Theta_p)	turns in [0,1), fixed-point	stored phase carrier for coherence space; this is where phase persistence lives canonically	encoder injects, evolution advances	harmonic alignment, projection distance, memory identity
d6	basis9_flux	fixed-point scalar/vector (bounded)	gradient/flow axis; governs admissible delta "flows" and how structures transport across the manifold	evolution (bounded by constraints)	interaction transfer gating, gradient constraints
d7	basis9_phantom	fixed-point (bounded)	classification/threshold axis; out-of-phase coexistence and "dark matter" style non-interaction lives here	coherence classifier + constraints	whether a state is interacting vs non-interacting regime
d8	basis9_aether	fixed-point (bounded)	stabilization/damping axis; clamps high-frequency delta energy and prevents runaway oscillation	stabilizer + constraints	stability, damping, safe spider-map output bounds
d9	basis9_nexus	fixed-point (bounded)	relational binding / cross-link axis; governs structural linkage and consolidation behavior	band/binding logic	clustering, anchor consolidation, "objectness" persistence

The durable minimum state you already locked is the anchor ledger tuple: anchor_id, tau_q, theta_q, chi_q, m_q. Everything else may exist as derived cache unless explicitly versioned as durable basis9_q[9]. The important thing is that theta_q is stored phase in turns, tau_q is the causal tick coordinate, chi_q is the coherence quantity, and m_q is the mass ledger used for forgetting/leakage.

Cold Spot traversal (relative ledger discontinuity in phase):
- When a `CMB_COLD_SPOT` constraint packet applies to the current phase-shell domain (region descriptor membership), the lattice MAY
  exhibit a relative discontinuity in phase evolution that manifests as correlated changes across two ledgers:
  (a) `chi_q` control/visualization stability fade, and (b) `m_q` canonical forgetting via mass leakage into the global reservoir.
- These are distinct ledgers. Correlation is expected only through shared constraint bias; no direct equivalence is assumed.
- Leakage observed in the near-critical headroom band (below the cap, never at 1.0) during traversal may be labeled hawking-like for
  telemetry, without introducing a new emission operator.

2.3.1 Emergent Coherence (Derived Observable; Non-Storage)

Coherence is NOT a stored variable. It is an emergent observable computed from relative
interaction, amplitude-driven Hilbert dilation, and phase-angle dispersion.

Canonical coherence observable (integer dispersion proxy; Blueprint APPENDIX AG):
Given a set of phase positions {theta_u64_i} sampled across active lanes/neural_objects at a tick boundary:

Interpretation:
- R_u64 near 0 indicates phase alignment (low dispersion).
- Larger R_u64 indicates phase dispersion (decoherence pressure).
This coherence observable is a telemetry quantity and MAY be used for admissibility predicates and stabilization decisions,
never as a stored memory state.

Harness requirements (integer-only):
- If all theta_u64_i are equal, R_u64 MUST be 0.
- If theta_u64_i are uniformly dispersed on the ring, R_u64 MUST grow toward its saturation range as N grows.

Bindings to imagined, inferred, renamed, or intended symbols are prohibited.

If no concrete export exists, the specification MUST bind the symbol to:
- a module-level authority, and
- an enforced behavior or constraint.

```text

m = clamp01( |s_band| )  where s_band is the unquantized spider mixture scalar computed from aggregate deltas

Define envelope headroom gate:

h = budget_state (from higher-tier read-path envelope)

Then eligibility is:

E_band = h * clamp01( p ? r ) * m

Interpretation:
	-	If the band is coherent and persistent (p high), and not risky (r low), and actually changed (m high), it is eligible.
	-	If the band is stable but unchanged, it does not waste summary bandwidth.
	-	If the band is noisy/risky, it is suppressed regardless of change magnitude.
	-	If headroom is low, emissions scale down automatically.

4.1.8.3 Emission threshold is derived from budget (no arbitrary cutoff)

We do not pick a fixed threshold like 0.3. The threshold is derived so that the expected number of emitted pulses fits the higher-tier capacity.

Let:
	-	M = number of candidate bands in the sealed window
	-	P_hi = higher-tier pulse budget per window
	-	reserve = safety fraction derived from observed jitter (measured) so we don't saturate the window

## A.21.2 Match 2: `Kernel` (Spec L137-L161)

```text

EigenWare operates as a closed, phase-evolving system in which amplitude represents the
tensor gradient of time and phase evolution is constrained by relativistic dilation.

Amplitude modulates the effective circumference of Hilbert space. As amplitude increases
(e.g., as particle velocity approaches c), the admissible phase manifold contracts, producing
time dilation. Observed density and gravitational effects arise from phase packing density,
not intrinsic mass.

Particles are excitations within a 9D manifold represented across three axioms.
Quasiparticles are excitations spanning three or more axioms.

Phase angle is defined geometrically and derived from measured kernel impulses, not inferred
from symbolic clocks or abstract frequencies.

Kernel pulses are treated as measured signals (voltage, EM waveform, execution cadence),
and phase is extracted directly from these signals.

1.2 Execution Role

This section defines the physical substrate on which all EigenWare computation operates.

It establishes:
- time as relative (tick time),
- amplitude as time dilation factor,

### Service Engine Pipeline Isolation (Compute Buffer, Not Projection)

Normative intent:
- The **simulation substrate** (9D lattice, manifold fields, anchor-internal constraint tables) is an internal compute buffer.
- The **service engine pipeline** (Unreal/PhysX/headless) consumes **artifact frames** only.
- Artifact frames are produced when **pulse updates begin** (projected pulse_index changes) and are derived from committed constraint packets + scalar projections.
- The 9D lattice MUST NOT be exposed unless PROJECTION_PRIVILEGED is explicitly unlocked.

#### Isolation & Artifact Emission (Runtime Lines)

```cpp
// Backend interface consumes artifacts only; no substrate pointers.
// This is how we prevent accidental "universe exposure" in public service mode.

The spider projection maps the 9D manifold state into:
- a **directional bias** for phase propagation (`f_code`),
- a **scalar projection of the time-metric gradient** along that direction (`a_code`).

SECTION 4.1.3 - Weight Derivation for P_SUM_CTX (No Arbitrary Numbers)

P_SUM_CTX weights are derived, not chosen. The derivation is performed during a calibration pass on a fixed training slice (or the initial crawl corpus segment) and then frozen as part of the snapshot. Once frozen, the weights are constants for deterministic replay.

We define a tier-summary objective J that encodes what this tier is for:

J = E[ ?chi_band ] + E[ ?cont_band ] ? lambda_violation * E[ V ] ? lambda_clamp * E[ C ] ? lambda_budget * E[ B ]

See: Match 2: `calibration` (Spec L629-L653) (canonical description).


All expectations E[?] are computed over the calibration sample windows, deterministically.

Axis weights are derived from axis "marginal utility" with respect to J. For each axis i, we compute an importance score S_i:

S_i = E[ | ?J / ?x_i | ]  /  ( epsilon + E[ cost_i ] )

Interpretation: weight an axis more if changing it consistently improves coherence persistence and binding stability, but discount it if it is expensive or destabilizing.

The denominator cost_i is not guessed. It is derived from observed update economics:
```

### Match 3: `Direction` (Spec L667-L691)

```text
4.1.3.1 How we compute ?J/?x_i without floating ambiguity

We do not use symbolic differentiation. We use deterministic finite differences on the calibration data:

For each calibration event e with normalized delta components x_i(e), we estimate:

gain(e) = (?chi_band(e) + ?cont_band(e)) ? lambda_violationV(e) ? lambda_clampC(e)

Then, for each axis i, define a signed contribution proxy:

g_i(e) = gain(e) * sign(x_i(e)) * min( |x_i(e)|, x_cap )

This is the "directional usefulness" of axis i for improving J in that event. We then define:

S_i_num = mean_over_e( |g_i(e)| )

This is effectively a robust approximation to E[ |?J/?x_i| ] without requiring differentiable closed forms.

4.1.3.2 How we compute cost_i from measurable terms

We set cost_i as:

cost_i = a0 * I_compute_i + a1 * I_memory_i + a2 * I_instability_i

Each term is measurable from the calibration run:
```

### Match 4: `Metric` (Spec L137-L161)

```text

EigenWare operates as a closed, phase-evolving system in which amplitude represents the
tensor gradient of time and phase evolution is constrained by relativistic dilation.

Amplitude modulates the effective circumference of Hilbert space. As amplitude increases
(e.g., as particle velocity approaches c), the admissible phase manifold contracts, producing
time dilation. Observed density and gravitational effects arise from phase packing density,
not intrinsic mass.

Particles are excitations within a 9D manifold represented across three axioms.
Quasiparticles are excitations spanning three or more axioms.

Phase angle is defined geometrically and derived from measured kernel impulses, not inferred
from symbolic clocks or abstract frequencies.

Kernel pulses are treated as measured signals (voltage, EM waveform, execution cadence),
and phase is extracted directly from these signals.

1.2 Execution Role

This section defines the physical substrate on which all EigenWare computation operates.

It establishes:
- time as relative (tick time),

- **Determinism**: FloatMap v1 canonical bytes; quantize to $10^{-18}$ at the event boundary; locked rounding = round-half-to-even; **no platform trig** and **no wall-clock** in canonical paths; explicit wrap rules; deterministic K-cap neighbor ordering
- **Viewport**: a read-only observer to visualize coherence/attention and relational drift ("watch it think")

-- Runtime Plumbing Addendum (Normative, Implementable) --
Implementation Patch: int64/u64 Phase Ring Mapping + Amplitude Tensor Constraint

This addendum defines a canonical phase representation that maps the full 64-bit integer
domain to the circumference of a circle (unit ring topology) while preserving amplitude
as a separate tensor constraint that gates/weights phase interactions. All original
content in this section remains unchanged and authoritative; this is additive only.

H.PHASE.1 Canonical Representation
- Hot-path phase coordinate SHALL be represented as `uint64_t phase_u64`.
- Wrap SHALL be achieved by modulo-2^64 arithmetic (well-defined for unsigned integers).
- Signed phase deltas SHALL be derived without relying on signed overflow.

H.PHASE.2 Mapping to Circle (Conceptual; Diagnostics Only)
- Conceptual angle: `angle_radians = (phase_u64 / 2^64) * (2*pi)`.
- This conversion SHALL NOT be required for hot-path coherence gating.

```cpp

H.PHASE.4 Amplitude as Tensor Constraint (Eligibility, Not Rescale)
- Amplitude SHALL NOT rescale phase or phase deltas.
- Amplitude SHALL act strictly as a tensor that gates/weights which phase interactions
  contribute to coherence, resonance, commit_state, or crosstalk coupling.

Canonical gating rule (lane i interacting with lane j):
- Let `d = |delta_phase(i, j)|` (minimal arc, u64-derived).
- Let `g = amplitude_gate_u64(i, j)` (tensor-derived gate expressed in phase ring units).
- If `d >= g`, interaction weight SHALL be zero.
- Else, interaction weight SHALL be a deterministic monotone function of `d/g`.

### Match 1: `Tiered` (Spec L2932-L2956)

```text

To cancel perspective bias:

Delta_S_corrected_k = Delta_S_constrained_k
                      - mean(Delta_S_constrained_k over window W)

This operator preserves structure while canceling observational drift.

The apparent randomness and dark-sector behavior arise from this correction.

SECTION 4 - Tier Coupling, Commit Barriers, and Literal-Pulse Aggregation Across Tiers

EigenWare runs as a tiered manifold: lower tiers carry finer-grain phase evolution and local interactions; higher tiers carry compressed, longer-range structure and stable context. The tiers do not compete or "collide." They are causally ordered by a strict commit_state protocol: a higher tier may only commit_state updates derived from a lower tier after the lower tier's commit_state slice is finalized for the same causal window. This is the formal version of your invariance rule: the system must maintain at least one shared phase/time invariance between tiers, and the higher tier must remain at minimum one step behind the lower tier's finalized state. This guarantees deterministic evolution and prevents contradictions where one tier "pulls" the other into an inconsistent history.

A tier is defined by its tick cadence (how often it commits), its allowable update density (how many pulses it can commit_state per window under the GPU envelope), and its harmonic coupling law (how widely activations spread). Lower tiers are allowed to be "busy" internally without forcing higher tiers to mirror every microstep; higher tiers see only compressed summaries. The compression interface between tiers is not a bulk state copy. It is a literal pulse stream that encodes aggregated deltas and band activations using the same pulse payload used everywhere else: (eid, tau_q, tier_id, f_code, a_code, profile_id, causal_tag). This keeps the system lightweight and uniform: tiers speak the same language, just at different granularities.

The engine divides time into commit_state windows. A commit_state window is a deterministic slice of tau_q in which pulses are applied in a fixed order and then the tier's state is sealed. Within a window, the tier maintains an ephemeral resonance working set (the "currently active harmonics"), but it does not store long-lived activation objects. Once the window closes, only the durable attractor state changes remain (anchor/band signatures, chi/continuum updates, binding topology changes), and the resonance working set is allowed to decay naturally unless reinforced by subsequent pulses. This ensures that "activation comes and goes" without implying that learned structure disappears.

See: Match 4: `Observational` (Spec L2926-L2950) (canonical description).


The summary itself is literal pulses by design. For each relevant attractor (typically a band coord_sig rather than every member), the lower tier computes an aggregate delta in Basis9 and compresses it through the same spider graph encoder, producing an f_code and a_code. The profile used for these summaries is not identical to the lower tier's internal evolution profile. It is a "tier-summary profile" whose harmonic law is explicitly broader for contextual memory activation, because higher tiers exist to represent long-range coupling and context. Concretely: the harmonic weight falloff Wn is slower in the context profile than in the core evolution profile, meaning higher harmonics retain more weight and therefore spread resonance across a wider binding neighborhood. That is the mechanism by which higher tiers can "activate context" from compressed signals without having to replay all lower-tier micro-activity.

Because summaries are pulses, tier-to-tier scaling becomes a scheduling and compression question rather than a bandwidth question. The lower tier can run very fine-grained updates locally (high pulse density, narrow coupling, clamp-heavy stability), while the higher tier consumes a smaller pulse stream (lower density, broader coupling, higher harmonic expressivity). The higher tier's pulses should be interpreted as coarse-grained resonance excitations that bind and stabilize macro-structure: phrase-level or paragraph-level context in language, object-level or region-level invariants in world simulation. The lower tier handles detailed local changes; the higher tier handles persistent structure and global field evolution.

A critical invariance is that tier summaries must be deterministic and order-insensitive with respect to microstep scheduling. That means the summary cannot depend on the sequence in which equivalent pulses happened within the lower-tier window, only on their net coherent effect after projection and band consolidation. Practically, the tier summary is computed from stable band aggregates: circular mean phase (in turns, wrapped), aggregate chi/continuum measures, and net binding deltas. Those are then turned into one or more pulses per band (or per dominant attractor) rather than per micro-update. If the lower tier had to split or merge bands, that structural event is represented as pulses too, using causal_tag to mark the event type so the higher tier interprets it as topology change rather than ordinary phase drift.

### Match 2: `Sparse` (Spec L1417-L1441)

```text
  mapping from hub constraints + local residuals to per-tile luminance/chroma statistics).
- If a full pixel buffer is required, it is produced by a deterministic renderer that consumes
  hub constraints; the renderer is a pure function of committed state at tau_q boundaries.

Delta transport (eigen residual preferred):

- Partition the output into deterministic tiles (same tiling rules as the image constructor).
- For each tile, form a small coefficient vector in a fixed basis (e.g., DCT-like or a fixed
  eigen basis derived and frozen by calibration), and transmit only coefficient deltas:

Delta_c_tile = c_tile(t) - c_tile(t-1)

- Coefficient deltas are sparse by construction when the scene is stable; unstable tiles emit
  more deltas. No arbitrary thresholds are required if you cap to top-K by magnitude with a
  deterministic tie-break rule.

Event gate:

A tile is eligible for emission in a window if either:
- its phase-transition gate is true (Section 2.5), or
- the hub indicates a structural update binding for that tile (tile->hub binding updated).

This keeps presentation bandwidth aligned with actual state change.

6.11 File class encoding: images (2D) and latent 3D (headless v1)

See: Match 3: `Dependency` (Spec L1579-L1603) (canonical description).


6.12 File class encoding: audio (pitch identity and event identity)

Audio is encoded as frame-based spectral streams. From the same stream, EigenWare promotes two families of attractors.

AUDIO_BAND_PITCH is promoted when a stable fundamental + harmonic ratio stack persists across frames. This supports note-like recognition (hearing a sound and identifying pitch class or stable tone identity).

AUDIO_BAND_EVENT is promoted when a stable spectral envelope and transient coord_sig persists across examples. This supports recognizing sources and events (footsteps, door slam, engine rev, bird call), even when pitch varies.

Both families bind into SCENE_* bands (especially SCENE_AUDIO and SCENE_AV) so recognition becomes contextual: the same sound may map differently depending on scene constraints, and the scene band reduces ambiguity by conditioning residual encoding.

6.13 File class encoding: video (motion motifs and synchronized scenes)

Video is encoded as (a) image tile streams per frame, (b) motion residual streams across frames, and (c) synchronized audio streams when present. Motion residuals form VIDEO_BAND attractors for repeated dynamics (walk cycles, impacts, oscillations). When audio is present, SCENE_AV promotion is preferred over isolated VIDEO_BAND promotion because joint stability reduces compute and improves recognition reliability.

6.14 Extractor registry: versioning and normalization rules

Extractor behavior must never drift silently. Every extractor_id references a versioned normalization contract. Normalization defines what bytes are digested, how whitespace is handled, whether punctuation is stripped, how Unicode is normalized, and how segmentation boundaries are determined. Any change to extraction, normalization, or segmentation requires a new extractor_id and produces a new artifact_id or stream_id mapping.

A minimal extractor registry entry includes: extractor_id, supported_mime, normalization_rules_digest, segmentation_rules_digest, and profile_defaults (which profile_id to use for that extractor's streams).

## Canonical Closure

EigenWare treats time as a curved field in a 9D manifold. Amplitude encodes its gradient. Phase propagates at invariant speed c, accumulates via metric path length, and is stored cyclically within a hardware-bounded phase lattice.


================================================================
APPENDIX I -- Crawler & Encoder Code-Space Separation (Normative)
================================================================

I.1 Purpose

Establish unbreakable separation between:
(a) external syntactic acquisition,
(b) deterministic phase-compatible transduction,
(c) simulation substrate evolution,

so that no external component can bypass coherence gating, amplitude clamping,
causal-tag validation, or memory admission control.

I.2 Crawler Role & Output Contract (Authoritative)

Crawler = pure producer.
Zero write access to simulation state, zero knowledge of phase, amplitude, d_tau,
coherence, constraint-resolution cycle index, or manifold.

Mandatory output structure per record:

CrawlerRecord {
    source_id:          immutable string or uint64
    acquisition_seq:    monotonic uint64 (order only - not wall-clock time)
    raw_payload:        bytes or string
    modality_tag:       enum { text, audio, image, numeric, graph, other }
    provenance_digest:  SIG9(raw_payload || source_id || acquisition_seq)
}

Forbidden in crawler:
- computation or storage of phase, amplitude, dln*, spider projection, coherence R
- any mutation of GlobalState or pulse buffer
- any decision about constraint-resolution cycle cadence, injection timing, or causal eligibility

I.3 Encoder Role & Output Contract (Authoritative)

Encoder = deterministic one-way transducer.
Input = one CrawlerRecord.
Output = zero or one PulsePacket.

PulsePacket:

PulsePacket {
    metric_bias:        float in [-B_max, B_max]
    direction_bias:     float in [-1, 1]
    anchor_delta_fp:    int64_t
    domain_id:          uint32_t
    causal_tag:         uint32_t
}

Constraints:
- |metric_bias|     <= env("env/max_metric_bias", 0.3)
- |direction_bias| <= 1.0
- anchor_delta_fp is relative only
- causal_tag in ProfileRegistry[domain_id].allowed_tags

Forbidden in encoder:
- emission of absolute phase, frequency, amplitude, d_tau
- computation of relativistic or coherence terms
- any write to GlobalState outside staged pulse queue

I.4 Injection Membrane (Authoritative)

ingest_pulse(GlobalState* gs):

1. Dequeue <=1 PulsePacket
2. If none -> return
3. gs->pulse_A           = clamp(metric_bias, a_min, a_max)
4. gs->pulse_f           = clamp(direction_bias * f_scale, f_min, f_max)
5. gs->pulse_anchor_fp   = anchor_delta_fp
6. gs->current_causal_tag= causal_tag
7. Consume packet

No other GlobalState fields may be modified.

================================================================
APPENDIX J -- Canonical Simulation Tick Pipeline (Normative)
================================================================

J.1 Execution Order (Authoritative)

1. Pulse ingest
2. Effective constant derivation
3. Coherence pre-gate
4. Anchor application & phase coupling
5. Phase propagation (c-bounded, wrapped)
6. Amplitude evolution (metric update, clamped)
7. Resonance evaluation
8. Sparse commit_state decision
9. Optional commit_state (admission-controlled)
10. Tick advance

Reordering, skipping, or bypassing steps is forbidden.

J.2 Invariants Enforced

- No phase advance without coherence
- No commit_state without TickContext
- No external bypass of gate
- Fatal on invariant violation

================================================================


J.3 Coherence Pre-Gate -- Integer-Space Gate Implementation (Normative, Implementable)

This section defines an integer-only coherence gate compatible with the blueprint's
coherence semantics without requiring floating-point trig in the hot path. The original
constraint-resolution cycle ordering remains unchanged; this is additive enforcement logic.

J.3.1 Canonical Coherence Observable (Hot Path)
- Coherence SHALL be computed from the distribution of lane phases at the current constraint-resolution cycle.
- The hot-path coherence estimate SHALL be derived via deterministic bucket concentration.

J.3.2 Bucketization
Let `B = N_theta` (phase resolution buckets).
Bucket index:
  `bucket = floor(phase_u64 * B / 2^64)`

J.3.3 Deterministic Coherence Estimate (Q32)
Define:
- `n = number of active lanes`
- `c[k] = count of lanes in bucket k`

Crosstalk permitted only if:
|chi| >= chi_min and R^(tau) >= R_min and R^(tau+1) >= R_min,
else chi equiv 0.

K.4 Metric Perturbation Law

G_tau^(tau+1) <- G_tau^(tau+1) +

APPENDIX P -- Phase Resolution, Integer Arithmetic, and Amplitude Doppler (Normative)
================================================================

P.1 Integer-Only Phase Arithmetic (Authoritative)

All phase-related quantities SHALL be represented exclusively in signed 64-bit integers.

Authoritative representations:

- theta_fp        : int64   // phase position
- delta_theta_fp  : int64   // phase increment per constraint-resolution cycle
- N_theta         : int64   // total phase states per turn
- c_max_delta_fp  : int64   // invariant speed bound

Floating-point arithmetic is FORBIDDEN in any function reachable from:
- phase_accumulation()
- coherence gating
- commit_state logic
- tier coupling enforcement

Any implementation violating this rule is non-compliant.

---

P.2 Turn Resolution Derived from Geometry and Amplitude

A full phase turn corresponds to 2pi radians.

The total discrete phase capacity per turn is defined as:

N_theta = floor( (2pi) * A_eff * S )

Where:
- A_eff is the effective amplitude after Doppler correction
- S is a fixed radian-resolution scale (integer constant)
- N_theta in (0, 2^63 - 1)

No fixed global turn lattice is permitted.
Phase resolution MUST vary with amplitude.

Canonical constants (example, not negotiable in a given build):

RADIAN_SCALE = 1_000_000_000_000_000_000  // 1e18 resolution per radian

---

P.3 Amplitude as Time-Metric Gradient

Amplitude represents the scalar projection of the 9D time-metric gradient along the
current phase propagation direction.

Amplitude is bounded by silicon limits:

A_min <= A <= A_max

All amplitude values MUST be clamped before further use.

---

P.4 Doppler Frequency of Amplitude (Metric-Only)

Amplitude represents a propagating time-metric gradient and therefore admits a
relativistic Doppler correction based on its velocity relative to the phase frame.

Define:

beta_A = (v_A * v^_theta) / c     ,  |beta_A| <= 1

The Doppler factor is:

D_A = sqrt( (1 + beta_A) / (1 - beta_A) )

The effective amplitude is:

A_eff = clamp( A * D_A , A_min , A_max )

Important constraints:

- Doppler correction applies ONLY to amplitude.
- Phase propagation speed is NEVER Doppler-shifted.
- No phase delta may depend directly on beta_A or D_A.

---

P.5 Integer-Safe Doppler Application

Doppler correction SHALL be applied as follows:

1. Compute beta_A and D_A in floating-point OUTSIDE the causal core.
2. Quantize D_A into fixed-point:

   doppler_fp = round( D_A * DOPPLER_SCALE )

3. Clamp doppler_fp to implementation bounds.
4. Compute effective amplitude in integer arithmetic:

   A_eff_fp = (A_fp * doppler_fp) / DOPPLER_SCALE

5. Clamp A_eff_fp to [A_min_fp, A_max_fp].

After step (2), no floating-point arithmetic is permitted.

---

P.6 Placement in Canonical Tick Pipeline

Appendix J, Step 2 (Effective Constant Derivation) is expanded as:

2. Effective constant derivation
   -> compute base amplitude from metric gradient
   -> compute Doppler factor from relative amplitude velocity
   -> apply Doppler to amplitude (metric-only)
   -> clamp to silicon bounds
   -> derive N_theta from (2pi * A_eff * S)
   -> derive c_max_delta_fp from N_theta and invariant speed

This ordering is mandatory.

---

P.7 Determinism Guarantee

Given:
- identical anchor-biased substrate configuration
- identical crawler records
- identical environment constants

The following MUST be bit-identical across runs:

- theta_fp trajectories
- commit_state histories
- control_chain_sig9

Any deviation constitutes a fatal specification violation.

## 0. Scope and Intent

This document is the **single authoritative blueprint** for the EigenWare system as executed on a **single machine**.
It defines the complete execution model, invariants, runtime structure, kernel coupling, and supervision logic required
to run EigenWare as a **product-like system** without cloud, orchestration, or distributed assumptions.

This blueprint is:
- Execution-complete
- Deterministic within a fixed environment
- Append-only hardened
- Free of optional or interpretive clauses

Anything not defined here is explicitly out of scope.

# EigenWare Blueprint v51 -- 1. Core Invariants (Non-Negotiable)

Bundle generation: 2026-02-11T04:19:55Z

## 1. Core Invariants (Non-Negotiable)

1. The system is a **closed simulation** after kernel start.
2. No external data may inject state after initialization.
3. All evolution is constraint-resolution cycle-based and internally timed.
4. Physics violations are **fatal to the simulation**.
5. Runtime failures are **recoverable at the process level**.
6. No silent corruption is permitted.
7. Determ reveals
8. Anchors (including the CMB Cold Spot substrate anchors) are **pre-encoded** and MUST be present as immutable runtime artifacts before tick 0. Boot performs **binding only** (allocation + registration), not impulse solving.
9. Anchor encodings and anchor constraint tables are **immutable post-start**. Any change to anchor memory, anchor signatures, or anchor constraint fields is a **fatal invariant violation**.
10. Pulses are transient constraint packets. A pulse MUST be **projected through anchor constraints** before any operator may apply it. Anchors constrain pulses; pulses MUST NOT mutate anchors.
11. Observation is privilege-gated. The public surface MUST expose **dict-map variables only** (key/value scalar fields). Any "universe/projection materialization" is privileged and MUST be denied unless an explicit unlock contract is satisfied.
12. Astrophysical constants and genesis bias terms are compile-time or frozen-ingress values. Runtime re-estimation, override via environment variables, or drift-fitting constitutes a **spec violation**.

13. The simulation substrate (9D lattice + internal manifold state) is a **compute buffer only**. It MUST NOT be projected into any public service engine pipeline. Downstream integration (Unreal, PhysX, stratum-like clients) SHALL receive only **artifact frames** derived from committed constraints and scalar observables (dict-map values), never raw 9D lattice state or pointers.
14. Constraint tables are encoded as part of the anchor encoding. Artifact emission begins only when pulse-driven updates begin (projected pulse_index advances) and SHALL be derived from committed constraint packets plus scalar projections. No artifact may require exposing the 9D lattice itself.

Determinism is guaranteed only within:
- the same machine
- the same GPU
- the same driver
- the same binary

Cross-environment determinism is explicitly not required.

1.5 Constraint Operators Required by Effective-Constants Pipeline

Purpose
The effective-constants pipeline in kernel/constraints/kernel_derive_constraints.cu requires two base constraint operators. These operators MUST be:
- Relative: computed from relative inputs (no fixed literal constants as computational truth).
- Deterministic: same inputs produce same outputs (no hidden randomness).
- Bounded: outputs must remain within known safe ranges to prevent runaway amplification.
- Composable: safe to call every tick and by multiple equation modules.

Non-negotiable rule
All physical constants used by the simulator are treated as effective values (for example h_eff, k_B_eff, c_eff, etc.). Baseline textbook constants may exist only as reference anchors and MUST NOT be used directly in computation outputs.

# EigenWare Blueprint v51 -- 2. System Layers

Bundle generation: 2026-02-11T04:19:55Z

- Phase evolution
- Pulse generation
- Operator application
- Invariant enforcement

### 2.2 Runtime Layer (Host-Side)
- Kernel lifecycle management
- Heartbeat monitoring

```text
9.2 Deterministic replay contract (strict mode)

EigenWare must support a strict replay mode where the same inputs (same artifacts and the same registries) produce the same artifact_id values, stream_id values, segment map coord_sig, record ordering within each tau_q commit_state window, promotion/merge/split decisions (and their trace log), and final container coord_sig for a fixed fixture corpus.

Strict mode requires deterministic sorting order of discovered artifacts, traversal order of segments within artifacts, tie-breakers in promotion/merge logic, and explicit seed usage. Promotion decisions must emit a deterministic reason code and a compact decision trace that can be replayed.

9.3 Budget + backpressure subsystem (enforced envelope)

9.4 Dedup + near-dup filter (mandatory)

See: Match 3: `Manager` (Spec L1841-L1865) (canonical description).


9.5 Provenance + license tagging (first-class metadata)

Every ManifestRecord includes provenance (publisher/org/domain), license_hint, retrieval method, trust_class, and domain_id. Missing provenance defaults to low trust. Provenance stabilizes memory topology and supports later filtering.

9.6 Extractor robustness (fail-closed)

On parse error, do not emit ambiguous pulses. Emit a structured error log with artifact_id, extractor_id, and reason code; optionally retry with a fallback extractor_id. Never silently drop errors; never continue on partial assumptions.

9.7 A/V time alignment repair (deterministic correction)

Captions/transcripts can drift. EigenWare supports a deterministic alignment correction: estimate a single offset parameter over a fixed window by maximizing coherence between caption tokens and audio event/pitch candidates; apply and lock; record the parameter in ManifestRecord metadata so replay is stable. No adaptive drift correction in strict mode.

```text

	-	Compute ?5 from theta_byte_turns(bj) relative to theta_carrier (5.11.3).
	-	Construct a Basis9 delta with:
	-	dominant phase term: ?5
	-	a small nexus binding hint ?9 toward the current sentence/paragraph context band (so formation is context-situated)
	-	clamp terms ?7/?8 set conservatively based on novelty risk (derived from how often this staging band produced thrash in recent windows)
	-	Compress ? via the spider graph under the crawler formation profile P_CRAWL_FORM into (f_code, a_code).
	-	Emit a pulse targeting the staging band eid with causal_tag = ACTIVATE or DRIFT depending on whether this byte is a boundary byte (see 5.11.5).

	3.	After bytes are injected, emit a boundary pulse:

	-	A "word boundary" pulse that indicates end-of-token, which helps the manifold learn consistent segment closure.
	-	This is represented as a pulse with the same eid, but with causal_tag carrying a boundary subcode and an a_code bucket that selects a short harmonic spread (so closure binds into the sentence band but doesn't thrash globally).

All pulses are committed at the current tau_q window under the crawler tier policy. If the window budget is insufficient, the encoder truncates formation streams deterministically (first N bytes) and logs truncation in strict replay mode.

5.11.5 Boundary encoding (start/end anchors without storing letters)

Human reading robustness (first/last letter effect) is modeled here as a boundary emphasis rule. It is not mystical; it is a deterministic encoding choice to increase attractor separability with minimal pulses.

Boundary rule:
	-	The first byte b1 and last byte bn of a token receive an amplitude boost via derived amplitude u(e) (5.11.4 novelty-aware), because boundaries increase retrievability and reduce collisions.
	-	Interior bytes receive lower amplitude.
	-	The boost factor is not arbitrary: it is derived by maximizing formation separability on a calibration slice under a fixed pulse budget, again using J restricted to formation fidelity and band collision penalties.

## APPENDIX R -- Pulse-Driven Kernel Coupling & Recursive Control (Normative)

### R.1 Closed-Loop Simulation Law

Let the simulation state at constraint-resolution cycle *n* be:

S_n = { Phi_n, C_n, T_n, E_n }

State evolution:

S_n_plus__1 = F(S_n, P_n)

No external inputs are permitted post-start.

---

### R.2 Pulse Control Equation

Each constraint-resolution cycle emits exactly one pulse:

P_n = { A_n, omega_n, theta_n, kappa_n }

Computed as:

A_n = clamp( f_A(E_n, C_n), A_min, A_max )
omega_n = f_omega(T_n, Phi_n)
theta_n = Phi_n mod PHASE_PERIOD
kappa_n = argmin_k L_k(S_n)

All functions are deterministic and invariant-derived.

---

### R.2.1 Anchor-Projected Pulse Invariant (Runtime Lines)

Normative rule:

- Pulse packets are **attempted constraints**.
- The anchor substrate provides the **reference frame + gating tensor**.
- The operator MUST consume `pulse_projected` (not `pulse_raw`).
- The anchor tables MUST remain read-only for the full process lifetime.

```cpp
// Host-side: bind anchor tables once (no impulse solving).
struct AnchorBindingV1 {
    const AnchorStateQ63* anchors_ro;   // read-only
    q63_t gate_q63[9];                  // gating tensor derived from pre-encoded anchor constraints
    uint64_t anchor_sig_boot;          // stored once
};

static inline void bind_anchor_tables_or_halt(
    AnchorBindingV1* binding,
    const AnchorStateQ63* anchors_ro,
    const q63_t gate_q63_in[9],
    uint64_t anchor_sig_boot,

    EW_REQUIRE(anchors_ro != nullptr, last_violation_code, run_flag, VC_ANCHOR_REGEN_ATTEMPT);

    binding->anchors_ro = anchors_ro;
    for (int i = 0; i < 9; ++i) { binding->gate_q63[i] = gate_q63_in[i]; }
    binding->anchor_sig_boot = anchor_sig_boot;
}

// Per-cycle: project pulse through anchor gate before operator application.
static inline ConstraintPacketV1 enforce_anchor_projected_pulse_or_halt(
    const AnchorBindingV1* binding,
    const ConstraintPacketV1& pulse_raw,
    uint64_t anchor_sig_now,
    volatile uint32_t* last_violation_code,
    volatile uint32_t* run_flag
) {
    EW_REQUIRE(binding != nullptr, last_violation_code, run_flag, VC_ANCHOR_REGEN_ATTEMPT);

    // Anchor immutability check.
    enforce_anchor_immutability_or_halt(anchor_sig_now, binding->anchor_sig_boot, last_violation_code, run_flag);

    // Projection (anchors constrain pulses; pulses cannot mutate anchors).
    return project_pulse_or_halt(pulse_raw, binding->gate_q63, last_violation_code, run_flag);
}
```

### R.2.2 Fully Enumerated, Per-Anchor Harmonic Fingerprint (Normative)

Goal:

- Anchors MUST boot with a deterministic *harmonic identity* ("fingerprint") so that
  semantic + physics constraints are already present before the first pulse.
- The fingerprint MUST be fully enumerated **per anchor** (anchor_id-indexed), with a
  deterministic generator so no implementer guesses.
- This is *binding logic*, not an impulse initializer: it never integrates, solves, or iterates
  a physics system. It only computes a stable identity basis from existing anchor payload.

Normative rules:

1. For each anchor_id i in [0 .. anchor_count-1], substrate control SHALL ensure:

   anchors[i].fp = ew_build_anchor_fp(i, anchors[i].coord)

   exactly once **before** the kernel tick loop begins (unless the anchor bank already ships
   with fp pre-encoded).

2. The anchor immutability coord_sig (`anchor_sig_boot`) MUST cover the full `AnchorStateQ63`
   byte range, including `fp`. If fp is missing or differs, immutability enforcement MUST fail.

3. The projection step MUST treat fp as read-only identity basis. fp MAY NOT be exported
   as lattice addressability; it is projection-only (dict-map lane selection).

Runtime lines (binding-only):

```cpp
#include <stdint.h>

static inline uint64_t ew_sig_bytes_u64(const void* data, uint64_t nbytes) {
    const uint8_t* p = (const uint8_t*)data;
    uint64_t h = 0;
    for (uint64_t i = 0; i < nbytes; ++i) {
        // Mix byte stream deterministically with word-size-derived shifts only.
        h = ew_mix64(h ^ (uint64_t)p[i] ^ (i << (64 / 9)));
    }
    return h;
}

static inline void enumerate_anchor_fingerprints_or_halt(
    AnchorStateQ63* anchors_rw,
    uint32_t anchor_count,
    volatile uint32_t* last_violation_code,
    volatile uint32_t* run_flag
) {
    EW_REQUIRE(anchors_rw != nullptr, last_violation_code, run_flag, VC_ANCHOR_REGEN_ATTEMPT);

    for (uint32_t i = 0; i < anchor_count; ++i) {
        anchors_rw[i].fp = ew_build_anchor_fp(i, anchors_rw[i].coord);
    }
}

// Canonical anchor coord_sig covers coord + fp (full bytes), enforcing fp presence + immutability.
static inline uint64_t sig_anchor_table_or_halt(
    const AnchorStateQ63* anchors_ro,
    uint32_t anchor_count,
    volatile uint32_t* last_violation_code,
    volatile uint32_t* run_flag
) {
    EW_REQUIRE(anchors_ro != nullptr, last_violation_code, run_flag, VC_ANCHOR_REGEN_ATTEMPT);

    return ew_sig_bytes_u64((const void*)anchors_ro, (uint64_t)anchor_count * (uint64_t)sizeof(AnchorStateQ63));
}
```

Boot-chain schematic (host-side):

```cpp
// 1) Load or construct anchor bank (coords may be pre-encoded in spec artifacts).
AnchorStateQ63* anchors_rw = load_anchor_bank_or_halt(...);

// 2) Binding-only enumeration of per-anchor harmonic identity.
enumerate_anchor_fingerprints_or_halt(anchors_rw, anchor_count, last_violation_code, run_flag);

// 3) coord_sig covers the full anchor table (including fp).
const uint64_t anchor_sig_boot = sig_anchor_table_or_halt(anchors_rw, anchor_count, last_violation_code, run_flag);

// 4) Bind read-only view into kernel coupling (no impulse solving, no regeneration).
bind_anchor_tables_or_halt(&binding, (const AnchorStateQ63*)anchors_rw, gate_q63_in, anchor_sig_boot,
                          last_violation_code, run_flag);
```

Result:

- The first pulse arrives into an anchor substrate that already carries a deterministic,
  enumerated harmonic identity per anchor.
- Constraint artifacts can begin emitting immediately on pulse updates, without ever exposing
  the 9D lattice or requiring any impulse initializer.

---

### R.3 Operator Application Rule

Exactly one operator O_k executes per constraint-resolution cycle:

S_n_plus__1 = O_k(S_n, P_n)

If no operator satisfies invariants:
- write violation code
- clear run_flag
- halt kernel

Coherence is NOT a stored variable. It is an emergent observable computed from relative
interaction, amplitude-driven Hilbert dilation, and phase-angle dispersion.

Canonical coherence observable (integer dispersion proxy; Blueprint APPENDIX AG):
Given a set of phase positions {theta_u64_i} sampled across active lanes/neural_objects at a tick boundary:

Interpretation:
- R_u64 near 0 indicates phase alignment (low dispersion).
- Larger R_u64 indicates phase dispersion (decoherence pressure).

### Match 3: `Kernel` (Spec L137-L161)

```text

EigenWare operates as a closed, phase-evolving system in which amplitude represents the
tensor gradient of time and phase evolution is constrained by relativistic dilation.

Amplitude modulates the effective circumference of Hilbert space. As amplitude increases
(e.g., as particle velocity approaches c), the admissible phase manifold contracts, producing
time dilation. Observed density and gravitational effects arise from phase packing density,
not intrinsic mass.

Particles are excitations within a 9D manifold represented across three axioms.
Quasiparticles are excitations spanning three or more axioms.

Phase angle is defined geometrically and derived from measured kernel impulses, not inferred
from symbolic clocks or abstract frequencies.

Kernel pulses are treated as measured signals (voltage, EM waveform, execution cadence),
and phase is extracted directly from these signals.

1.2 Execution Role

1.6.1 Description

Amplitude is the lattice-local representation of temporal field gradient. It is not a UI rate,
a renderer detail, or a free parameter. It is the canonical scalar that binds the simulation's
base tick parameter (d_t) to local proper-time advance (d_tau) for each active lane/neural_object.

### Match 3: `Dependency` (Spec L1579-L1603)

```text
HTML pages are encoded as multiple streams: a structured block stream (title, headings, paragraphs, lists) and a link/context stream (anchor text, domain transitions). The encoder converts these into Type A/B/C pulses as defined in Section 5: direct activation for known terms, conservative formation for novel terms, and binding pulses for stable co-occurrence structures. Link context is treated as an explicit binding graph update, not as raw URL storage.

Plain text and Markdown are treated similarly, but the extractor is simpler (block/sentence/token) and the crawler uses surrounding path context (repo location, course module name, etc.) to create stable scene associations.

6.8 File class encoding: PDFs, LaTeX, BibTeX, and scientific material

LaTeX is ingested as structured sections, math environments, and definitions. BibTeX is ingested primarily as a reference graph: citation edges become binding updates between concept bands and source bands. The system does not treat citation counts as truth; it uses citation structure as context topology.

6.9 File class encoding: source code, specs, and software engineering assets

Source code is ingested as CODE_BAND evidence via language-specific AST extractors. In addition to AST streams, the crawler emits dependency streams: imports, symbol references, module graphs. These become bindings that allow EigenWare to retrieve and recombine code coherently without line-level memorization.

Specs and API docs are treated as dual streams: TEXT_BAND for the prose and CODE_BAND for the formal structures (schemas, function signatures). In a repo context, SCENE_CODEDOC bands become the persistent join so future work can activate "the spec + the implementation constraints" with minimal pulses.

6.10 File class encoding: structured data (JSON/YAML/TOML/CSV)

6.11 File class encoding: images (2D) and latent 3D (headless v1)

LATENT3D bands are updated headlessly from repeated 2D constraint evidence and motion evidence. The engine stores 3D hypotheses as constraint bundles (symmetry, rigidity, part graphs, relative proportions) and binds them to 2D evidence through nexus. Rendering is deferred; projection is treated as an internal operator for validating constraint consistency.

### Match 4: `Trace` (Spec L476-L500)

```text
A dominant-mode transition occurs when:

transition_mode = ( k_star(t) != k_star(t+1) )

Commit emission gate (event-driven):

transition_event = transition_phi OR transition_mode

If transition_event is false for all lanes/neural_objects in a commit_state window, the engine MAY
choose to emit:
- no telemetry updates, or
- only aggregate scalars (e.g., coherence), or
- only budget/control traces (strict replay mode).

If transition_event is true for any lane/neural_object, the engine MAY emit:
- the minimal delta set required to represent the transition (eigen coefficient deltas preferred),
- plus required control traces for replay.

Eigen-trajectory compounding (the "many actions in one pulse" mechanism):

In an eigen/diagonal update form, each eigen component advances by an integrated phase:

c_k(t+1) = c_k(t) * exp(-i * omega_k * d_tau)

This is a single deterministic operator application per commit_state boundary, but it may represent

### Match 2: `Sequences` (Spec L1154-L1178)

```text
This section defines the crawler and encoder as first-class components of the simulation itself, not external preprocessing scripts. The crawler does not "download text and store it as text" as the primary pipeline. Instead it drives a resonance-based ingestion process: web data is converted into pulses and injected into the manifold through the same GPU-executed electrical write-path used for all state evolution. The only persistent content is what collapses into stable resonance attractors (bands/anchors) under continuum and coherence rules. This prevents uncontrolled data bloat and keeps ingestion consistent with the closed causal system.

5.1 Subsystem placement: crawler and encoder live inside the simulation

5.2 What "persistent resonance of webpage data" means

See: Match 4: `Ingestion` (Spec L1140-L1164) (canonical description).


That is how "we don't lose data" coexists with decay. Activations decay; structure persists. When a page is ingested, the characters and sequences induce resonance trajectories. If those trajectories repeatedly reinforce coherent bands (high chi + stable continuum), the system stores a latent attractor representing that content. If the page is noisy, contradictory, or non-reinforcing, the excitation decays and leaves minimal residue beyond clamp/uncertainty traces. In short: persistence is earned by coherence over time, not granted by storage.

5.3 Ingestion pipeline as pulses, not files

See: Match 1: `Build` (Spec L1170-L1194) (canonical description).


5.4 Electronic signaling and execution: what is direct, what is derived


What is derived are the pulse coefficients. The encoder constructs pulse coefficients from observed page data (words, structure, links) according to deterministic mapping rules and injects those coefficients into the simulation. The persistent resonance is therefore a property of the manifold's evolution under those injected coefficients, not a property of hardware telemetry.

EigenWare does not guarantee:
- Cross-machine determinism

- Real-time behavior

### Match 1: `Guarantees` (Spec L710-L734)

```text
S_i = S_i_num / (epsilon + cost_i)

Then weights are:

w_i = S_i / ?_j S_j

We then quantize deterministically:

w_i_int = round_fixed(weight_scale * w_i)

Finally enforce ? w_i_int = weight_scale by adding/subtracting the rounding remainder to the largest weight component (deterministic tie-break: lowest axis index wins ties). These integer weights are stored in the snapshot as part of P_SUM_CTX versioned config.

SECTION 4.1.4 - What this derivation guarantees (and why phase/nexus typically win)

If the calibration data reflects language/context activation, the derived S_i will naturally favor:
	-	d5 (phase/coherence): because improvements in retrieval and continuum show up as coherent phase alignment effects
	-	d9 (nexus): because binding stability and contextual linking express through nexus coupling
	-	d8/d7 (aether/phantom): not because they "carry meaning," but because their clamp/instability correlation affects the penalty terms and thus regulates weight via cost_i
	-	spatial d1-d3: typically discounted because they contribute less to ?chi/?cont under language/context compared to phase/binding, and they often increase neighborhood expansion costs

So you get your "broader coupling for contextual memory activation" not by fiat, but because the calibration objective J rewards persistence and binding and penalizes instability and budget cost.

SECTION 4.1.5 - Amplitude Derivation for P_SUM_CTX (u -> a_code, shown work)

Amplitude in tier-summary pulses is not an arbitrary "strength." It is a derived control that selects (a) how confidently to propagate a summary update and (b) how much harmonic spread to allow without causing instability or exceeding the GPU envelope. We derive amplitude from the same objective J used for weight derivation, but now treating amplitude as a policy over propagation risk.

# EigenWare Blueprint v51 -- APPENDIX V -- Substrate_manager.cpp (Deterministic Pulse/Envelope Ledger Bridge)

Bundle generation: 2026-02-11T04:19:55Z

## APPENDIX V -- Substrate_manager.cpp (Deterministic Pulse/Envelope Ledger Bridge)

This appendix freezes the module `/mnt/data/Substrate_manager.cpp` as a **runtime artifact** and specifies, in execution order, what each component is, what it depends on, what it may read, what it may output, and what it must never do.

This module is treated as the **host-side pulse/envelope boundary** for EigenWare-style deterministic runtime operation. It is **event-driven**, meaning it advances only when called by the engine (no internal timers, no background threads).

### V.0 Artifact Identity

Artifact: `Substrate_manager.cpp` (module header indicates `manager_deterministic_memstate.cpp`)  
Role: deterministic configuration ingress + deterministic, in-memory envelope state tracker  
Persistence model: **RAM-only by default**; explicit export/import permitted as a deliberate act by the host (no implicit autosave).

### V.1 External Dependencies (Headers)

Allowed (frozen set) - C++/CUDA standard library only:

- <cstdint>, <cstddef>, <cstring>
- <array>, <vector>, <map>
- <string>, <sstream>
- <algorithm>
- <cstdio> (logging only)
- <stdexcept>

If any additional dependency is required, it MUST be explicitly justified and added as a pinned, vendored, versioned file under a leaf folder (no package managers).

### V.2 Inputs, Outputs, and Constraints (Execution Contract)

#### Inputs (legal)
1) Environment variables (Config ingress only):
- `EIGENWARE_CONFIG_JSON` (JSON object string)
- `NEURALIS_ENABLE_SNAPSHOT_CONFIG` (must be `"1"` to enable live substrate reference-derived config)
- `NEURALIS_SNAPSHOT_PATH` (optional path when live substrate reference-derived config is enabled)

2) Explicit call inputs (Envelope evolution):
- `EnvelopeCalibration` (frozen baselines; must not change during replay)
- `EnvelopeTelemetry` (per-window measured signals; read-only)
- `constraint-resolution cycle_id`, `tier_id`, `window_id` (explicit identifiers supplied by the engine)

#### Outputs (legal)
- `ConfigManager.get(...)` returns a value from config map (or default)
- `RuntimeEnvelopeState.update_for_window(...)` returns an `EnvelopeSnapshot`
- `RuntimeEnvelopeState.export_state()` returns a dict blob (no I/O)
- `RuntimeEnvelopeState.import_state(blob)` returns a reconstructed state object (explicit)
- `get_config_manager()` returns module singleton instance
- `get_envelope_state(...)` returns module singleton instance

#### Hard constraints (must hold)
- Determinism is enforced by integer fixed-point math (`FP_SCALE = 65535`) and deterministic rounding.
- No background threads. No internal time-based autosave.
- No disk I/O in the envelope tracker; export/import are in-memory transforms only.
- Any parsing failure is **fail-closed** (log error; do not partially assume).
- Ring eviction is deterministic (remove smallest `window_id`).

#### Forbidden behaviors (must never occur)
- Implicit persistence to disk (no autosave file writes).
- Internal timers that change behavior based on wall clock.
- Any mutation of simulation state (this module is host-side and read-path only relative to kernel state).
- Any "free" injection of values not derived from provided telemetry or frozen calibration.

#### Anchor Resonance Bank and CMB Cold Spot Pre-Bind (Foundational)

This Substrate Manager SHALL provide the **foundational, pre-encoded anchor bank** for the CMB Cold Spot substrate
and SHALL bind it into runtime memory **before tick 0**. This is **binding only** (allocation + registration + coord_sig mapping),
not impulse solving.

This bridge is required so that:
- Anchors have the correct resonance profiles for constraint encoding.
- Pulses can be projected through anchor constraints deterministically on the first update.
- No initializer script performs impulse calculations to "set anchors."

**Inputs (canonical; MUST match Appendix Z):**
- `FP_SCALE = 65535`
- `CMB_COLDSPOT_AMPLITUDE_FP = 4`
- `CMB_COLDSPOT_PHASE_FP = 910`
- `CMB_COLDSPOT_LON_FP = 38062`
- `CMB_COLDSPOT_LAT_FP = 12079`

**Anchor Set (cardinality-derived; 4 fields => 4 anchors):**
- `ANCHOR_ID_CMB_PHASE = 0`
- `ANCHOR_ID_CMB_AMPL  = 1`
- `ANCHOR_ID_CMB_LON   = 2`
- `ANCHOR_ID_CMB_LAT   = 3`

**Contract:**
- These anchors MUST be present and immutable post-start.
- Their resonance-driving lane MUST be stored in `coord[0]` (see `ew_build_anchor_fp`).
- Their harmonic fingerprint and resonance profile MUST be fully enumerated at bind time.

**Required Substrate Manager behavior:**
- On startup, Substrate Manager MUST call `ew_build_cmb_anchor_bank_or_halt(...)` once, store the anchor bank in read-only memory,
  compute its coord_sig for immutability enforcement, and pass only the read-only pointer into the kernel binder.
- On startup, Substrate Manager MUST call `ew_build_cmb_constraint_fabric_or_halt(...)` once, store the per-anchor `AnchorConstraintFieldV1`
  pages in read-only memory, and include them in the same immutability coord_sig/commitment as the anchor bank.
- Text/byte ingress MUST be decoded to pulse deltas ONLY inside the substrate boundary using `ew_decode_u8_phase_delta_q63(byte, cf_ro[...])`.
  The phase map and schema pages MUST NOT be exported, dumped, or returned by any API.
- After tick 0, any write to the anchor bank, resonance fields, or constraint pages is a fatal violation.

### V.3 Exceptions and Failure Semantics

This module is allowed to raise only these categories of exceptions:
- `ValueError` on invalid construction parameters (e.g., `ring_size <= 0`)
- `RuntimeError` if `update_for_window(...)` is called while paused before any live substrate reference exists
- Standard exceptions may surface from explicit caller actions (e.g., invalid blob passed to `import_state(...)`)

All internal parsing failures (e.g., malformed JSON in env config) MUST be logged with `exc_info=True` and MUST NOT silently continue with partial assumptions.

### V.4 Component Breakdown (in sequence)

#### Part A -- Module header and intent (Lines 1-13)
- Defines the artifact's deterministic intent and explicitly rejects implicit disk/live substrate reference dependence.

#### Part B -- Imports (Lines 15-23)
- Only stdlib. No scheduler effects.

#### Part C -- Logging (Lines 25-35)
- Establishes a fixed log format and fail-closed posture.
- Constraint: logging must not alter determinism (no log-dependent branches).

#### Part D -- ConfigManager (Lines 42-130)
Artifact: `ConfigManager`  
Purpose: deterministic config ingress, with strict gating for live substrate reference-derived config.

Dependencies:
- Env vars (`EIGENWARE_CONFIG_JSON`, `NEURALIS_ENABLE_SNAPSHOT_CONFIG`, `NEURALIS_SNAPSHOT_PATH`)
- Optional filesystem walk ONLY when live substrate reference config is explicitly enabled.

Inputs:
- optional constructor `live substrate reference_path` (used only when live substrate reference config is enabled)

Outputs:
- `get(path, default)` returns config value or default
- `reload_if_changed()` returns True only if live substrate reference config is enabled AND mtime increased

Constraints:
- Snapshot-derived config is disabled unless `NEURALIS_ENABLE_SNAPSHOT_CONFIG == "1"`.
- If env JSON parse fails, config remains empty (fail-closed).

#### Part E -- Fixed-point utilities (Lines 137-154)
Artifacts:
- `FP_SCALE`
- `_clamp01_fp(num)`
- `_ratio_fp(numer, denom)`

Purpose:
- Provide deterministic, integer-only normalized metrics (0..FP_SCALE).

Constraints:
- `_ratio_fp` uses deterministic round-half-up.

#### Part F -- Frozen dataclasses (Lines 156-189)
Artifacts:
- `EnvelopeCalibration` (frozen baselines)
- `EnvelopeTelemetry` (per-window measured signals)
- `EnvelopeSnapshot` (the only visibility output permitted to scheduling/pulse logic)

Constraints:
- All are `frozen=True` for immutability; ensures replay stability.

#### Part G -- RuntimeEnvelopeState (Lines 191-316)
Artifact: `RuntimeEnvelopeState`  
Purpose: event-driven deterministic envelope tracker with in-RAM ring checkpoints.

Inputs:
- `calibration` (frozen) at init time
- `update_for_window(...)` call inputs: constraint-resolution cycle_id, tier_id, window_id, telemetry

Outputs:
- Returns `EnvelopeSnapshot` per call
- Maintains an internal deterministic control-chain coord_sig (SIG9 chaining)

Key rules:
- If paused, `update_for_window` returns the last live substrate reference unchanged; if none exists, raises RuntimeError.
- Saturations are computed as fixed-point ratios:
  - compute saturation: exec/budget
  - memory saturation: bw_used/bw_budget
  - queue saturation: max(0, latency-latency_ref)/latency_span
- headroom = 1 - max(saturations)
- budget_state_fp = headroom_fp (halved under thermal_throttle gate)

Ring eviction:
- If ring exceeds size, delete smallest window_id (deterministic).

Export/import:
- `export_state()` returns blob; does not write.
- `import_state(blob)` reconstructs deterministically; caller chooses to use it.

Constraints:
- No disk I/O. No background loop. No time-based evolution.

#### Part H -- Module-level singletons (Lines 319-342)
Artifacts:
- `_CONFIG_SINGLETON`, `_ENVELOPE_SINGLETON`
- `get_config_manager()`
- `get_envelope_state(...)`

Purpose:
- Provide stable, process-lifetime identity for config and envelope state.

Constraints:
- Singleton creation is deterministic (first call wins).
- The singleton persists only while the process lives (RAM persistence).

```cpp
   1: /*
   2: manager_deterministic_memstate.cpp
   3: 
   4: Deterministic, event-driven, in-memory envelope state for EigenWare.
   5: 
   6: Contract:
   7: - No background threads.
   8: - No time-based autosave. State changes only on explicit update_for_window(...) calls.
   9: - No disk I/O. export_state()/import_state() are pure in-memory transforms.
  10: - Deterministic eviction: if capacity exceeded, evict smallest window_id.
  11: 
  12: NOTE: This is blueprint-grade compile-safe C++17. It is intentionally dependency-light.
  13: If you prefer a full JSON parser, swap parse_flat_json_object(...) with a vetted library.

// ## APPENDIX W -- Interactive Session Host (Normative, Deterministic)
// 
// ### W.0 Purpose and Scope
// 
// This appendix defines the Interactive Session Host (ISH), the host-side runtime layer that enables
// real-time, bidirectional human interaction with a persistent EigenWare kernel.
// 
// The ISH provides:
// - live text ingress
// - pulse translation
// - controlled kernel stimulation
// - kernel readout
// - human-readable response emission
// 
// The ISH SHALL NOT:
// - modify kernel state directly
// - bypass the injection membrane
// - introduce nondeterministic control flow
// - execute inside the kernel
// - generate pulses without explicit user input
// 
// The kernel remains the sole cognitive substrate.
// 
// ---
// 
// ### W.1 Architectural Position
// 

// Compile-safe stubs generated for integration
#include <stdint.h>
struct EigenwareCompileStub { uint64_t unused; };
static inline void eigenware_noop_stub(void) { }

```cpp
// BEGIN HARDENED BLOCK: original content preserved as comments
// 
// All arrows represent strictly ordered, synchronous calls.
// 
// ---
// 
// ### W.2 Interaction Turn Contract (Authoritative)
// 
// Each user interaction SHALL follow this sequence:
// 
// 1. User submits UTF-8 text
// 2. Input validation
// 3. Text Ingress Adapter produces PulsePacket
// 4. Pulse injected via membrane
// 5. Kernel advances (fixed constraint-resolution cycles or until commit_state)
// 6. Kernel state sampled (read-only)
// 7. Response Decoder generates output
// 8. Output returned to user
// 
// No step may be skipped or reordered.
// 
// ---
// 
// ### W.3 Text Ingress Adapter
// 
// **Artifact:** TextIngressAdapter
// 
// **Inputs:** UTF-8 text string  
// **Outputs:** PulsePacket (fixed-point, invariant-respecting)
// 
// **Constraints:**
// - Deterministic mapping
// - Envelope-respecting amplitude
// - No direct state mutation
// 
// Invalid pulses are fatal to the simulation.
// 
// ---
// 
// ### W.4 Interaction Turn Controller
// 
// **Artifact:** InteractionTurnController
// 
// Defines kernel evolution window per user turn.
// 
// **Modes:**
// - FIXED_TICKS
// - WAIT_FOR_COMMIT
// 
// Kernel persistence across turns is mandatory.
// 
// ---
// 
// ### W.5 Kernel Readout Adapter
// 
// **Artifact:** KernelReadoutAdapter
// 
// **Outputs (read-only):**
// - coherence_fp
// - resonance index
// - tier_id
// - last operator id
// - control_chain_sig9
// 
// Sampling must not affect kernel timing.
// 
// ---
// 
// ### W.6 Response Decoder
// 
// **Artifact:** ResponseDecoder
// 
// Maps kernel metrics to human-readable output.
// 
// **Modes:**
// 1. Template-based
// 2. Symbolic decode
// 3. Hybrid renderer (external)
// 
// Decoder output must not influence kernel evolution.
// 
// ---
// 
// ### W.7 Interactive Session Runtime Artifact
// 
// **Artifact:** InteractiveSessionHost
// 
// Responsibilities:
// - Maintain turn order
// - Surface liveness and diagnostics
// - Bind UI to interaction contract
// 
// UI choice must not alter kernel behavior.
// 
// ---
// 
// ### W.8 Determinism and Failure Guarantees
// 
// - Identical inputs -> identical outputs
// - No silent drift
// - Clean halt on invariant violation
// 
// ---
// 
// ### W.9 Explicit Prohibitions
// 
// Forbidden:
// - Kernel-generated language
// - LLM pulse injection
// - UI state as kernel state
// - Autonomous pulse generation
// 
// Violations constitute spec failure.
// 
// ---
// 
// ### W.10 System Capability
// 
// With Appendix W, EigenWare supports real-time conversational interaction
// without compromising determinism or physics integrity.
// 
// 
// 
// ## APPENDIX X -- Interactive Runtime File Map (Normative, Line-Itemized)
// 
// This appendix enumerates **all host-side files required** to realize an interactive EigenWare system
// as defined by Appendix W. Each file is specified as a deterministic artifact with its role,
// dependencies, inputs, outputs, constraints, and failure semantics.
// 
// This appendix follows the same structural format as Appendix V (Substrate_manager.cpp) and is
// authoritative for interactive execution.
// 
// No file listed here may be omitted without breaking the interaction contract.

// 
// 
// 
// ## APPENDIX Y -- Interactive Runtime Source Artifacts (Normative, Line-by-Line)
// 
// This appendix provides **line-by-line authoritative specifications** for the three required
// interactive runtime files. These definitions are **append-only** and do not modify or weaken
// any existing invariant.
// 
// The files defined here are:
// 1. `interactive_session.cpp`
// 2. `text_ingress_adapter.cpp`
// 3. `ui_host.cpp` (console baseline)
// 
// Each file is specified as:
// - an execution artifact
// - broken into ordered parts
// - with explicit dependencies, inputs, outputs, constraints, and failure semantics
// 
// These specifications are sufficient to implement the files mechanically without interpretation.
// 
// ---
// 
// ### Y.1 `interactive_session.cpp` -- Canonical Interaction Orchestrator

### Y.4 Global Interactive Constraints
// 
// Across all files in this appendix:
// 
// - No autonomous pulse generation
// - No kernel-side language logic
// - No nondeterministic scheduling
// - No implicit persistence beyond pulse ledger
// - No background threads
// 
// Violation constitutes a specification failure.
// 
// ---
// 
// ### Y.5 Resulting Capability
// 
// With Appendices W, X, and Y present, the EigenWare blueprint now defines:
// 
// - Interactive contract
// - File-level runtime map
// - Line-by-line source obligations
// 
// This completes the **interactive execution surface** of EigenWare.
// 
// ---
// 
// 
// 
// ## APPENDIX Z -- Astrophysical Constraint Constants (Normative, Hard-Coded)
// 
// This appendix **immutably hard-codes the astrophysical constants** used by EigenWare's
// Substrate Manager and envelope calibration logic. These values are no longer external
// configuration inputs. They are **part of the canonical physics contract**.
// 
// All simulations claiming compliance with this blueprint MUST use these exact values,
// scales, and derivations.
// 
// ---
// 
// ### Z.0 Scope and Authority
// 
// These constants originate from the observed **CMB Cold Spot** and large-scale
// cosmological background measurements. They serve as **initial substrate constraints**
// and **global bias terms**, not as time-varying inputs.
// 
// These values:
// - are applied at simulation genesis only
// - MUST NOT be altered at runtime
// - MUST NOT be re-estimated dynamically
// - MUST be represented in fixed-point form internally
// 
// ---
// 
// ### Z.1 Reference Astrophysical Quantities (Floating-Point, Conceptual)
// 
// The following are the conceptual source values (for documentation only):
// 
// - CMB mean temperature:
//   T_CMB = 2.72548 K
// 
// - CMB Cold Spot temperature deviation:
//   DeltaT_CS ~ -150 muK = -1.5 x 10^-^4 K
// 
// - Relative cold-spot deviation:
//   epsilon_CS = DeltaT_CS / T_CMB ~ -5.502 x 10^-^5
// 
// - Cold Spot angular radius:
//   theta_CS ~ 5 deg  = 0.0872664626 rad
// 
// - Cold Spot sky centroid (Galactic coordinates):
//   l = 209 deg 
//   b = -57 deg 
// 
// These floating-point values SHALL NOT be used directly in computation.
// 
// ---
// 
// ### Z.2 Canonical Fixed-Point Encoding

// EigenWare uses a global fixed-point scale:
// 

// Compile-safe stubs generated for integration

// 

// Compile-safe stubs generated for integration

// END HARDENED BLOCK
```
CMB_COLDSPOT_AMPLITUDE_FP = round(FP_SCALE * |epsilon_CS|)
                           = round(65535 * 5.502e-5)
                           = 4
```cpp
// BEGIN HARDENED BLOCK: original content preserved as comments
// 
// This value is intentionally small and functions as a **global symmetry-breaking seed**,
// not an energy source.
// 
// #### Z.2.2 Cold Spot Phase Bias
// 
// The angular radius is mapped to phase space:
// 

// Compile-safe stubs generated for integration
#include <stdint.h>
struct EigenwareCompileStub { uint64_t unused; };
static inline void eigenware_noop_stub(void) { }
// END HARDENED BLOCK
```

```cpp
// BEGIN HARDENED BLOCK: original content preserved as comments
//

// 
// #### Z.2.3 Cold Spot Direction Bias (Galactic Projection)
// 
// Longitude and latitude are encoded independently:
// 

// Compile-safe stubs generated for integration
#include <stdint.h>
struct EigenwareCompileStub { uint64_t unused; };
static inline void eigenware_noop_stub(void) { }
// END HARDENED BLOCK

//

// 
// ### Z.3 Canonical Genesis Constraint Vector
// 
// At simulation genesis, the following vector SHALL be applied exactly once:
// 

// Compile-safe stubs generated for integration
#include <stdint.h>
struct EigenwareCompileStub { uint64_t unused; };
static inline void eigenware_noop_stub(void) { }

    direction_lat_fp  : 12079
}
```cpp
// BEGIN HARDENED BLOCK: original content preserved as comments
// 
// This vector:
// - initializes EnvelopeCalibration
// - biases initial resonance topology
// - seeds long-range coherence structure
// 
// No other astrophysical constants are permitted.
// 
// ---
// 
// ### Z.4 Substrate Manager Binding (Normative)
// 
// `Substrate_manager.cpp` SHALL:
// 
// - import these constants directly
// - forbid override via environment variables
// - forbid live substrate reference-derived replacement
// - treat them as immutable compile-time values
// 
// Any attempt to alter these constants constitutes a **specification violation**.
// 
// 
// Additional binding invariants (anchor-precedence; no impulse initializer):
// 
// - Substrate_manager.cpp MUST expose a binding call that registers the pre-encoded
//   anchor tables (CMB Cold Spot anchors) before kernel start.
// - This binding is allocation/registration only. It MUST NOT compute impulses,
//   solve for anchor placement, or re-estimate anchor coherence.
// - Anchor bindings MUST be treated as read-only for the full runtime.
//

```cpp
// Host-side schematic: substrate manager binding path.
struct SubstrateGenesisBindingV1 {
    const AnchorStateQ63* anchors_ro;
    uint32_t anchor_count;
    uint64_t anchor_sig_boot;
};

static inline void substrate_manager_bind_genesis_or_halt(
    SubstrateGenesisBindingV1* out_binding,
    const AnchorStateQ63* anchors_ro,
    uint32_t anchor_count,
    uint64_t anchor_sig_boot,
    volatile uint32_t* last_violation_code,
    volatile uint32_t* run_flag
) {
    EW_REQUIRE(out_binding != nullptr, last_violation_code, run_flag, VC_ANCHOR_REGEN_ATTEMPT);
    bind_preencoded_anchors_or_halt(anchors_ro, anchor_count, last_violation_code, run_flag);
    out_binding->anchors_ro = anchors_ro;
    out_binding->anchor_count = anchor_count;
    out_binding->anchor_sig_boot = anchor_sig_boot;
}
```

// ---
// 
// ### Z.5 Determinism and Reproducibility Guarantee
// 
// Because these constants are now hard-coded:
// 
// - identical binaries on identical hardware MUST produce
//   bit-identical early-phase evolution
// - CMB-derived asymmetry is guaranteed to be present
//   in every compliant simulation
// - no external configuration can silently alter cosmological bias
// 
// This closes the final external-dependency loophole.
// 
// ---
// 
// ### Z.6 Explicit Prohibitions
// 
// The following are forbidden:
// 
// - replacing constants via config files
// - runtime estimation of cosmological parameters
// - stochastic perturbation of these values
// - environment-variable overrides
// 
// Violations SHALL be treated as fatal specification breaches.
//

// # APPENDIX AG -- Canonical Integer Amplitude Gating (Normative)
// 
// This appendix freezes the **phase-amplitude separation** in an implementation-ready form:
// 
// - Phase state and phase deltas SHALL remain pure `int64` ring values (wrap via native overflow).
// - Amplitude SHALL NOT rescale phase state. Amplitude SHALL act only as a **tensor gate / weight** on phase interactions.
// - Coherence `R` SHALL be computed in integer space without trig or floats.
// 
// This appendix is intended to be applied at **Phase 5 -- Coherence Gate** and reused by resonance and commit_state logic.
// 
// ## AG.1 Definitions (ASCII-safe)
// 
// - `theta_u64`: lane phase state in unsigned ring `[0, 2^64)`.
// - `dtheta_i64`: signed minimal-arc delta in `[-2^63, 2^63)`, produced by two's-complement subtraction.
// - `a_gate_q63`: signed fixed-point weight in Q63 (range `[-INT64_MAX, INT64_MAX]`).
//   - `a_gate_q63 = INT64_MAX` represents "full influence".
//   - `a_gate_q63 = 0` represents "fully gated off".
//   - Negative values invert contribution sign (signed inversion).
// 
// No other amplitude scaling is permitted in coherence, resonance, or commit_state.
// 
// ## AG.2 Gating Tensor Storage (Sparse by Default)
// 
// Implementation SHALL provide at least one of:
// 
// 1. **Per-lane vector gate**: `a_lane_q63[i]`
// 2. **Sparse per-pair overrides**: `a_pair_q63[(i,j)]` in deterministic COO order (sorted by `(i,j)`)
// 
// Normative resolution rule:
// 
// - `gate_weight_q63(i,j)` returns:
//   - `a_pair_q63(i,j)` if present
//   - else `a_lane_q63[i]` if per-lane mode is enabled
//   - else `INT64_MAX` (full influence)
// 
// Bootstrap (Invariant-0 compliant):
// 
// - `a_lane_q63[i] = INT64_MAX` for all active lanes, OR
// - `a_pair_q63` empty (no overrides), with `gate_weight_q63(i,j) = INT64_MAX`
// 
// This avoids the degenerate case where off-diagonal weights default to zero and coherence becomes trivially maximal.
// 
// ## AG.3 Canonical Gate Function (Fixed-Point Correct)
// 
// The original "multiply then shift by log2(lanes)" sketch is only safe if the word-size fixed-point shift is included.
// Normative implementation SHALL use a Q63 multiply:

### Match 1: `Substrate` (Spec L121-L145)

```text
- The referenced symbol MUST exist verbatim OR
- The binding MUST explicitly declare the quantity as an emergent invariant enforced by module logic.

Bindings to imagined, inferred, renamed, or intended symbols are prohibited.

If no concrete export exists, the specification MUST bind the symbol to:
- a module-level authority, and
- an enforced behavior or constraint.

Violation of this invariant invalidates the binding.

================================================================
Section 1 - Temporal Substrate and Phase Geometry
================================================================

1.1 Description

EigenWare operates as a closed, phase-evolving system in which amplitude represents the
tensor gradient of time and phase evolution is constrained by relativistic dilation.

Amplitude modulates the effective circumference of Hilbert space. As amplitude increases
(e.g., as particle velocity approaches c), the admissible phase manifold contracts, producing
time dilation. Observed density and gravitational effects arise from phase packing density,
not intrinsic mass.

```

### Match 2: `manager` (Spec L1841-L1865)

```text
- BandTypeRegistry: band_type -> promotion rules, merge/split hysteresis rules, legal binding kinds, persistence rules (including SCENE_*)

Every registry entry must be versioned. A behavior change is a new ID, not an in-place update.

9.2 Deterministic replay contract (strict mode)

EigenWare must support a strict replay mode where the same inputs (same artifacts and the same registries) produce the same artifact_id values, stream_id values, segment map coord_sig, record ordering within each tau_q commit_state window, promotion/merge/split decisions (and their trace log), and final container coord_sig for a fixed fixture corpus.

Strict mode requires deterministic sorting order of discovered artifacts, traversal order of segments within artifacts, tie-breakers in promotion/merge logic, and explicit seed usage. Promotion decisions must emit a deterministic reason code and a compact decision trace that can be replayed.

9.3 Budget + backpressure subsystem (enforced envelope)

9.4 Dedup + near-dup filter (mandatory)

See: Match 3: `Manager` (Spec L1841-L1865) (canonical description).


9.5 Provenance + license tagging (first-class metadata)

Every ManifestRecord includes provenance (publisher/org/domain), license_hint, retrieval method, trust_class, and domain_id. Missing provenance defaults to low trust. Provenance stabilizes memory topology and supports later filtering.

9.6 Extractor robustness (fail-closed)

On parse error, do not emit ambiguous pulses. Emit a structured error log with artifact_id, extractor_id, and reason code; optionally retry with a fallback extractor_id. Never silently drop errors; never continue on partial assumptions.

# A.43 APPENDIX AX -- 9D SUBSTRATE MANIFOLD (NORMATIVE, DETERMINISTIC)

# A.44 ==========================

AX.0 Purpose
This appendix normatively defines the explicit 9D substrate manifold referenced by the Spider Projection.
It closes all implicit references to manifold_9d.cu and defines raw_9d unambiguously.

AX.1 Canonical State Container
A single global substrate manifold SHALL exist:

int64_t manifold_q63[9];
int64_t manifold_prev_q63[9];

Each axis is Q63 fixed-point in [-1, +1]. Axis order is fixed and immutable:
0:X_spatial, 1:Y_spatial, 2:Z_spatial, 3:Temporal, 4:Coherence,
5:Flux, 6:Phantom, 7:Aether, 8:Nexus.

AX.2 Initialization
All axes SHALL initialize to zero. No randomness or entropy injection is permitted.

AX.3 Conservative Update Rule
Per constraint-resolution cycle, the manifold evolves via coherence-governed conservative ring exchange.

step_q63 = (INT64_MAX - R_i64) / 9

For i in [0..8]:
    j = (i + 1) mod 9
    delta = ((manifold_q63[j] - manifold_q63[i]) * step_q63) >> 63
    manifold_q63[i] += delta
    manifold_q63[j] -= delta

AX.4 Pulse Bias Injection
Pulse observables may bias axes via bounded additive deltas in Q63.
Bias MUST NOT exceed |step_q63| and MUST preserve boundedness.

AX.5 raw_9d Definition
raw_9d SHALL be defined as manifold_q63, with no alternative sources.

# A.45 APPENDIX AY -- EFFECTIVE CONSTANTS & METRIC PHASE PROJECTION

# A.46 ==========================

AY.1 Purpose
This appendix normatively defines phase delta derivation, metric projection, and coherence-governed motion.

AY.2 Spider Projection (Integer Form)
Each axis is normalized:
norm_q63 = (manifold_q63[i] + INT64_MAX) >> 1

Uniform weights:
w_q63 = floor(INT64_MAX / 9), remainder distributed to lowest indices.

Frequency code:
center_q63 = (norm_q63 - (INT64_MAX >> 1)) << 1
f_code_q63 += (center_q63 * w_q63) >> 63

Amplitude code:
a_code_q63 += (norm_q63 * w_q63) >> 63

AY.3 Base Phase Delta
speed_q63 = INT64_MAX - R_i64
c_max_delta = (1ULL << 63)
base_delta = sign(f_code_q63) * ((c_max_delta * speed_q63) >> 63)

AY.4 Metric Projection
delta_theta = (base_delta * a_code_q63) >> 63
delta_theta is clamped to [-c_max_delta, +c_max_delta].

# A.47 APPENDIX AZ -- AMPLITUDE UPDATE & RESONANCE EVALUATION

# A.48 ==========================

AZ.1 Amplitude Update
Amplitude SHALL be derived solely from normalized dispersion:
a_code_q63 = 1 - (R_i64 / INT64_MAX)

AZ.2 Resonance Evaluation
A resonance event SHALL occur when:
- R_i64 crosses a local minimum
- delta_theta maintains sign consistency across N constraint-resolution cycles

Resonance events trigger commit_state bucket writes per Appendix AG.

# A.49 APPENDIX BA -- DETERMINISTIC GRAPHICS READOUT CONTRACT

# A.50 ==========================

BA.1 Exported Readout Struct
constraint-resolution cycle_idx
R_i64
manifold_q63[9]
f_code_q63
a_code_q63

BA.2 Projection Rules
Position: (X_spatial, Y_spatial, Z_spatial)
Color intensity: R_i64 / INT64_MAX
Opacity: a_code_q63 / INT64_MAX

BA.3 Determinism
All graphics projections are read-only and do not affect kernel state.

# A.51 ==========================

BB.0 Purpose
This appendix freezes the executable C++ implementation structure corresponding exactly
to Appendices AX, AY, AZ, and BA. This closes the gap between specification and code.

No semantic freedom is introduced. This appendix is binding.

BB.2 Module Responsibility Binding

- manifold_9d.* implements Appendix AX verbatim.
- spider_projection.* implements Appendix AY spider math verbatim.
- effective_constants.* implements Appendix AY phase metric logic.
- resonance.* implements Appendix AZ resonance detection.
- history_buffer.* implements Appendix AG coherence history buffer.
- render_adapter.* implements Appendix BA graphics readout contract.

No module may implement logic assigned to another module.

---

BB.3 Numeric Policy Lock

All causal-core math SHALL use int64 fixed-point (Q63).
Floating-point math is permitted ONLY in render_adapter and app-level visualization.

---

BB.4 Runtime Ordering Guarantee

The runtime loop SHALL execute stages in the exact order defined in the canonical constraint-resolution cycle.
Deviation constitutes non-compliance.

---

BB.5 Determinism Guarantee

Given identical pulse inputs and anchor-biased substrate configuration, builds conforming to this appendix
MUST produce identical history buffers and render readouts.

# A.52 APPENDIX BC -- CONTROL FIELD (PERSISTENT PHASE BIAS, NORMATIVE)

# A.53 ==========================

BC.0 Purpose
This appendix defines a permanent, non-zero control field that introduces a
persistent phase bias into the system. The control field enforces a global
symmetry break and guarantees forward phase evolution even in the absence of
external pulses.

This appendix is normative and binding.

---

BC.1 Control Field Definition

A single immutable control offset SHALL be defined at boot:

int64_t base_offset_fp = 1;

This value represents the minimal non-zero quantum of phase advance.
It SHALL NOT be configurable at runtime and SHALL NOT be reset after initialization.

---

BC.2 Boot Initialization Rule

At system boot, prior to the first canonical constraint-resolution cycle:

theta_fp = base_offset_fp % (1ULL << 64);

This initializes the phase ring with a non-zero offset and breaks global symmetry.

---

BC.3 Implicit Drift Rule (Idle Ticks)

On every canonical constraint-resolution cycle, including idle constraint-resolution cycles with no external pulse input,
an implicit phase increment SHALL be applied:

dtheta_implicit = (base_offset_fp + seed) & 0xF;
theta_fp += dtheta_implicit;

Where:
- seed is a deterministic, bounded value derived from existing kernel state
  (e.g., constraint-resolution cycle index or lane index).
- The mask ensures the increment remains minimal and bounded.
- No condition may suppress this update.

---

BC.4 Persistence and Non-Reset Invariant

The control field SHALL persist for the lifetime of the process.
No reset, pause, or reinitialization path may zero or negate its effect.

Any implementation that permits global phase stasis violates this appendix.

---

BC.5 Integration with API Controllers

External APIs and host controllers MAY modulate pulse inputs, thresholds,
or readout cadence, but SHALL NOT override or disable the control field.

The control field operates beneath API-level intent and provides the
irreducible forward bias upon which all higher-order behavior is built.

---

BC.6 Semantics

The control field encodes no goals, preferences, or directives.
It represents a persistent phase gradient only.

All observable behavior emerges as a consequence of system dynamics
operating under this non-zero bias.

# A.54 APPENDIX BE -- AI INTERFACE & KERNEL PULSE COMPRESSION (NORMATIVE)

# A.55 ==========================

BE.0 Purpose

This appendix defines the explicit interface through which the AI layer
communicates with EigenWare and the mechanism by which multiple commands,
tasks, or intents are compressed into a single kernel pulse via pulse
amperage modulation.

This appendix is normative and binding.

---

BE.1 AI Interface Layer

The AI SHALL interact with EigenWare exclusively through a defined
AI Interface Layer (AIL).

The AIL:
- observes kernel state via read-only observables
- emits bounded control instructions as pulse descriptors
- performs no direct phase, coherence, or manifold writes

The AI Interface Layer SHALL be implemented above the Control Field
(Appendix BC).

---

BE.2 Command Encoding Model

Each AI-issued command SHALL be represented as a structured command vector:

C = { opcode, weight, priority }

Where:
- opcode identifies the task or routing action
- weight is a normalized scalar in [0,1]
- priority is an ordinal or bounded integer class

Commands do not directly map to pulses.

---

BE.3 Pulse Compression via Amperage Modulation

Multiple command vectors MAY be compressed into a single kernel pulse.

Compression is achieved by modulating pulse amperage as a superposition
of command weights.

Let:
- A_base be the base pulse amplitude
- w_i be the weight of command i

Then:
A_pulse = A_base * Sigma(w_i)

Subject to:
- A_pulse SHALL remain within bounded kernel limits
- No individual command may exceed its allocated contribution

This allows N commands to be expressed as one pulse without increasing
pulse count.

---

BE.4 Deterministic Decompression

Within the kernel, pulse amperage SHALL be decomposed deterministically
back into weighted command effects using the same ordered command list
and weights provided by the AI Interface Layer.

Ordering SHALL be stable and deterministic.

---

BE.5 Interaction with Control Field

Pulse compression SHALL NOT override:
- the implicit drift (Appendix BC)
- the base phase offset
- coherence gating

Compressed pulses bias phase evolution but do not halt or reverse it.

---

BE.6 Safety and Semantics

Pulse compression encodes no goals or desires.
It is a bandwidth optimization mechanism only.

All apparent AI behavior emerges from:
- control field motion
- coherence constraints
- pulse-weighted task modulation.

# A.56 APPENDIX BF -- OPCODE SET, COMMAND SCHEMA, & DETERMINISTIC DECOMPRESSION (NORMATIVE)

# A.57 ==========================

BF.0 Purpose

This appendix normatively defines:
(a) the canonical opcode set used by the AI Interface Layer (AIL),
(b) the command container schema (fixed-array and TLV-compatible),
and (c) the deterministic kernel-side decompression procedure by which
multiple commands are applied from a single compressed pulse.

This appendix is binding and append-only.

---

BF.1 Canonical Opcode Set

The following opcode identifiers are reserved and canonical. Implementations
MAY extend this set only by appending new identifiers; existing identifiers
and semantics SHALL NOT be altered.

Opcode identifiers are unsigned 16-bit integers.

- OP_NOOP            (0x0000): No operation.
- OP_IO_READ         (0x0001): Request input observation or sampling.
- OP_IO_WRITE        (0x0002): Emit output or actuation.
- OP_ROUTE           (0x0003): Route data between subsystems or buffers.
- OP_STORE           (0x0004): Persist state to storage.
- OP_FETCH           (0x0005): Retrieve external or cached data.
- OP_RENDER_UPDATE   (0x0006): Update render/readout state (non-causal).
- OP_TASK_SELECT     (0x0007): Select or activate a bounded task operator.
- OP_PRIORITY_HINT   (0x0008): Provide a scheduling or ordering hint.

No opcode may directly write phase, coherence, or manifold state.

---

BF.2 Command Representation

Each command SHALL be represented as a fixed-width record:

struct Command {
    uint16_t opcode;
    uint16_t priority;
    int64_t  weight_q63;
};

Where:
- opcode identifies the action (BF.1),
- priority is an ordinal class (higher value = higher precedence),
- weight_q63 is a normalized Q63 scalar in [0, INT64_MAX].

Commands SHALL be supplied to the kernel in a deterministic order or in a
container that can be deterministically ordered.

---

BF.3 Command Container Schema

Two equivalent container forms are permitted:

(A) Fixed-Array Schema (Default)
- A fixed-size array of N Command records (N is compile-time constant).
- Unused slots SHALL be filled with OP_NOOP and zero weight.

(B) TLV-Compatible Schema
- Commands encoded as Type-Length-Value records in a contiguous buffer.
- The kernel SHALL read commands in increasing memory address order.

Both schemas MUST yield identical ordering after normalization.

---

BF.4 Stable Ordering Rule

Before decompression, commands SHALL be ordered deterministically by:

1. priority (descending)
2. opcode   (ascending)
3. original index (ascending)

This ordering SHALL be identical across replays.

---

BF.5 Pulse Compression Carrier

A single PulseDescriptor carries an aggregate amplitude:

A_pulse_q63 = clamp_q63( Sigma weight_q63_i )

This value acts as a bandwidth carrier only and does not encode semantics.

---

BF.6 Deterministic Decompression Procedure

Within the kernel, decompression SHALL proceed as follows:

1. Compute total_weight_q63 = Sigma weight_q63_i over all commands.
2. For each command i in stable order:
   a. Compute allocation fraction:
      frac_i_q63 = (weight_q63_i << 63) / total_weight_q63
   b. Compute allocated amplitude:
      A_i_q63 = (A_pulse_q63 * frac_i_q63) >> 63
   c. Apply opcode-specific effects using A_i_q63 as a bounded modifier.

All arithmetic SHALL be integer-only and deterministic.

---

BF.7 Opcode Effect Constraints

Opcode effects:
- MUST be bounded functions of A_i_q63,
- MUST NOT override the Control Field (Appendix BC),
- MUST NOT halt phase evolution,
- MUST respect coherence gating.

If coherence disallows evolution, opcode effects MAY be deferred but
MUST NOT be discarded unless explicitly specified by the opcode.

---

BF.8 Safety and Semantics

This appendix introduces no goals, intent, or preference encoding.

Pulse compression and decompression are strictly bandwidth and scheduling
mechanisms operating atop:
- the Control Field (BC),
- the API Control Layer (BD),
- and the AI Interface Layer (BE).

All behavior remains an emergent consequence of constrained dynamics.


---

# A.58 Appendix Z -- Lattice Constraint Field Invariants (Normative)

This appendix is **additive and non-mutating**. All prior blueprint content remains byte-for-byte intact.
The following invariants are hereby declared **normative** and binding for all implementations.

---

## A.58.1 Match 1: `Minimal` (Spec L160-L184)

```text
- time as relative (tick time),
- amplitude as time dilation factor,
- phase as the sole state variable,
- kernel pulses as signal generators,
- and the prohibition of absolute clocks.

All subsequent sections depend on these definitions.

1.3 Derivable Calculations and Authorities

Authority source for phase deltas:
- delta_theta_fp SHALL be derived from kernel-observed impulse cadence (pulse edge count / cycle deltas) via a deterministic
  integer or LUT-based mapping owned by /core/scheduler/pulse_scheduler.cpp.
- The mapping MUST be replay-stable (same inputs -> same outputs) across platforms.

Phase accumulation (wrap-by-overflow, canonical):
- theta_u64_next = theta_u64 + (uint64_t)delta_theta_i64
- dtheta_i64     = (int64_t)(theta_u64_next - theta_u64)   // two's-complement subtraction yields minimal-arc signed delta

```

## A.58.2 Match 2: `History` (Spec L503-L527)

```text
No causality claim is made here. This is computational compression, not faster-than-light
propagation.

2.5.4 Contract Harness Obligations (Time-Dilation vs Energy-Scaling Disambiguation)

Because scaling time and scaling energy can be mathematically equivalent in an isolated system,
the harness MUST include a re-coupling interference test that distinguishes "proper-time lapse"
from "arbitrary Hamiltonian scaling" by comparing two subsystems after independent evolution.

Test fixture:

- Construct two identical lane ensembles S1 and S2 with identical initial phase/eigen states.
- Evolve S1 under amplitude history A1(tau_q) and S2 under amplitude history A2(tau_q) for the
  same number of commit_state windows, using the same base d_t and the same environment constraints
  except for the amplitude-driving inputs.
- Re-couple (bind) S1 and S2 by introducing a deterministic interaction window that depends on
  relative phase (e.g., binding strength proportional to cos(delta_phi)).

Acceptance criteria:

- The observed re-coupling coherence response MUST match the predicted relative proper-time
  offset derived from the lapse integral:

delta_tau_pred = sum_over_windows ( d_t / max(eps, amplitude_1) - d_t / max(eps, amplitude_2) )

```

## A.58.3 Match 3: `Buffer` (Spec L1034-L1058)

```text

SECTION 4.1.9 - Tier Envelope Measurement Mapping (Read-Path Only, No Meaning Injection)

4.1.9.1 Allowed telemetry signals (software-visible counters only)

The engine may use only standard software-visible metrics that are already accessible via GPU driver APIs or timing instrumentation. These include:
	-	Kernel dispatch time per window (measured by high-resolution timer around dispatch + completion barrier)
	-	Queue backlog (number of pending launches or measured completion latency)
	-	SM/compute utilization estimate (driver metric or inferred from elapsed time vs expected)
	-	Memory bandwidth utilization estimate (if available) or proxy from measured copy times / cache miss counters
	-	Allocation pressure (local to the engine: size of working buffers allocated/used)
	-	Thermal throttling indicators (if exposed) only as a "reduce workload" gate

No raw "electrical waveform," no per-transistor signals, no analog sampling. The counters are used only to shape how many pulses are processed/emitted per window.

	-	Wait on a deterministic barrier (CUDA event or equivalent)
	-	Stop timer at barrier completion

## A.60.1 Match 2: `Registry` (Spec L1014-L1038)

```text

SPLIT:
A split event emits:
	1.	A SPLIT pulse targeting eid_parent describing the split
	2.	Two MODE pulses (MODE_A and MODE_B) targeting the two child eids, encoding their centroids

The reason these are still "literal pulses" is that the higher tier already knows how to process pulses. We aren't introducing a new packet class; we are only adding deterministic tags that guide interpretation.

4.1.8.6 Deterministic routing of topology without extra payload fields

Topology needs identity mapping, but we said we're keeping pulses small. The deterministic way to avoid adding fields is:
	-	The eid in the pulse indicates the primary target (eid_new for MERGE, child eid for MODE_A/MODE_B).
	-	Any secondary identity mapping is derived from a deterministic registry rule: the lower tier commits a canonical ordering of band ids and stores a redirect table as part of durable state (not as per-pulse payload). The higher tier uses the same deterministic rule to interpret MERGE/SPLIT tags.

In other words: identity mapping is part of the shared VSD snapshot state, not transmitted every time.

4.1.8.7 Remains causal under tier ordering

All summary pulses emitted from tier L to tier L+1 carry tau_q equal to the sealed window index for tier L. Tier L+1 is forbidden to apply these pulses until tier L is sealed for that tau. This ensures that MERGE/SPLIT topology updates cannot arrive "early" and cannot conflict with lower-tier history. If summary bandwidth is insufficient, topology pulses take precedence over drift pulses (because topology errors cause long-lived divergence), which is a deterministic priority rule in the selection ranking.

SECTION 5.17 - Modality Delta Constructors (Explicit Mappings into Basis9)

Each modality has its own observation extractor, but all of them output a Basis9 delta packet before spider compression. The packet is "what changed" plus "what this evidence should bind to."

Text constructor (token instance)
A token instance in context is treated as a hub activation + binding update. If the token has a stable attractor, the encoder emits an activation pulse to the token band and a binding pulse (?9) token->hub(sentence/topic). If it is novel, it emits formation staging pulses (ASCII/byte phase injection) but still binds the staging band to the hub so collapse is context-shaped.

Image constructor (tile scan, headless)
An image is partitioned into deterministic tiles. Within a tile, pixel traversal is encoded as spatial deltas (?1, ?2), while pixel intensity/channel content becomes phase deltas (?5). Local gradient energy (edges) maps to ?6 as a deterministic function of |\nabla I| or |\Delta I|. Tile->hub binding uses ?9. Hub prediction reduces work by turning full encoding into residual encoding: the tile encoder compares observed local gradients and intensity statistics against hub-implied priors and emits only the difference.

Audio constructor (spectral frames)
Audio is segmented into deterministic frames, converted to a deterministic spectrum representation, then sparsified (top-K bins or energy-threshold bins). Frequency-bin index maps to phase on ?5; magnitude maps to amplitude via a_code; temporal adjacency binds frames through ?9. When hub context is active (topic/speaker/scene), the encoder emits residuals relative to the hub's expected spectral envelope, so stable background conditions compress aggressively.

Video constructor (image+motion+audio sync)
Video is treated as image tiles over time plus motion constraints. Motion residuals (block matching / flow proxies) map primarily to ?6 (flux-like change) and ?9 (temporal binding). Audio track is processed as in the audio constructor but additionally bound to frame-time hubs for synchronization.

A practical mapping table (Basis9 intent) that Copilot can implement without guesswork:

Feature	?1-?3	?5 (phase)	?6 (flux)	?7/?8 (stability)	?9 (binding)
text token event	optional	token phase residual / staging	context change rate	novelty risk/clamp	token?hub, token?token
image tile step	dx,dy	intensity/ch residual	edge/motion energy	noise/occlusion risk	tile?hub, tile?tile
audio frame bin	-	bin_id phase	magnitude change	noise floor / clipping risk	frame?hub, frame?frame

1.1 Description

EigenWare operates as a closed, phase-evolving system in which amplitude represents the
tensor gradient of time and phase evolution is constrained by relativistic dilation.

Amplitude modulates the effective circumference of Hilbert space. As amplitude increases
(e.g., as particle velocity approaches c), the admissible phase manifold contracts, producing
time dilation. Observed density and gravitational effects arise from phase packing density,
not intrinsic mass.

Particles are excitations within a 9D manifold represented across three axioms.
Quasiparticles are excitations spanning three or more axioms.

Phase angle is defined geometrically and derived from measured kernel impulses, not inferred
from symbolic clocks or abstract frequencies.

Kernel pulses are treated as measured signals (voltage, EM waveform, execution cadence),
and phase is extracted directly from these signals.

1.2 Execution Role

This section defines the physical substrate on which all EigenWare computation operates.

- Cluster coherence: sum or mean of member `chi_q` (exact integer math).

Energy transfer rule (deterministic skeleton):

- Let $E_i$ be a fixed-point "energy budget" derived from $\chi_i$ and/or excitation.
- Transfer from $i\to j$ during a tick occurs only when alignment is sufficient:
    $$\text{gate}_{ij} = \max(0, A_{ij})$$
    $$\Delta E_{i\to j} = g_{tier}\,w_{edge}\,\text{gate}_{ij}\,E_i$$

All terms (`g_tier`, `w_edge`, `E_i`) must be fixed-point; multiplications must use a locked rounding mode.

Bundle generation: 2026-02-11T04:19:55Z

## Z.8 Hubble Expansion Constraint Invariant

A Hubble-like expansion term SHALL be modeled as a global constraint field.
This term modulates:
- lattice scale evolution
- long-term divergence
- global constraint coupling

The Hubble term SHALL parameterize constraints, not create new ones.


Canonical global scaling rule (normative):
- The global scale factor a_global(tick) SHALL be derived from the Hubble constant H0 provided by the CMB anchor family.
- H0 is a committed anchor constant (CMB-derived) and SHALL NOT be user-tuned, rounded, or normalized.
- a_global(tick) exists only as a global scale field used for projection and long-horizon constraint coupling.
- a_global(tick) SHALL NOT inject energy and SHALL NOT bypass accept_state.

Deterministic computation (ASCII; fixed-point):
- t_phys_q32_32 = tick_time_phys_q32_32(current_state, inputs, ctx)
- H0_q32_32     = hubble_H0_from_cmb_anchor_q32_32(ctx)

- a_global_q32_32 = exp_fixed_q32_32(ln_a_q32_32)

No rounding rule (normative):
- a_global_q32_32 and all derived scales SHALL NOT be "rounded to nice numbers" or renormalized.
- Any quantization SHALL occur only by fixed-point domain selection (Q format) and SHALL be identical across platforms.

	-	band_thrashing_window is a deterministic indicator (splits+merges+projection failures in the window)

The coefficients a0, a1, a2 are not arbitrary either; they are derived from the hardware envelope:
	-	a0 is proportional to inverse of measured pulse throughput headroom

## A.71.1 Match 2: `Data` (Spec L657-L681)

```text

S_i = E[ | ?J / ?x_i | ]  /  ( epsilon + E[ cost_i ] )

Interpretation: weight an axis more if changing it consistently improves coherence persistence and binding stability, but discount it if it is expensive or destabilizing.

The denominator cost_i is not guessed. It is derived from observed update economics:
	-	cost_i = (pulse_sensitivity_i * compute_cost_proxy) + (memory_cost_proxy_i) + (instability_proxy_i)
	-	compute_cost_proxy comes from measured dispatch limits and actual pulse throughput in calibration
	-	instability_proxy_i is derived from how often changes along axis i correlate with band splits/merges or violation spikes

4.1.3.1 How we compute ?J/?x_i without floating ambiguity

We do not use symbolic differentiation. We use deterministic finite differences on the calibration data:

For each calibration event e with normalized delta components x_i(e), we estimate:

gain(e) = (?chi_band(e) + ?cont_band(e)) ? lambda_violationV(e) ? lambda_clampC(e)

Then, for each axis i, define a signed contribution proxy:

g_i(e) = gain(e) * sign(x_i(e)) * min( |x_i(e)|, x_cap )

This is the "directional usefulness" of axis i for improving J in that event. We then define:

S_i_num = mean_over_e( |g_i(e)| )

3.X.15 Unified Operator Harness Assembly

The unified harness executes all operator harnesses in order.
Failure of any step invalidates kernel coherence guarantees.
All harnesses MUST pass before deployment.

To cancel perspective bias:

Delta_S_corrected_k = Delta_S_constrained_k
                      - mean(Delta_S_constrained_k over window W)

This operator preserves structure while canceling observational drift.

The apparent randomness and dark-sector behavior arise from this correction.

SECTION 4 - Tier Coupling, Commit Barriers, and Literal-Pulse Aggregation Across Tiers


The tier coupling protocol is a two-phase handshake per window: finalize then summarize. First, the lower tier applies all pulses in that window, computes any required structural operations (band membership updates, merges/splits that have met evidence thresholds), updates its coherence ledger (chi decay and reinforcement), and seals the window. Sealing means: the tier produces a deterministic summary of the window's net effect that is independent of execution scheduling details inside the window. Second, the lower tier emits a summary pulse stream for the higher tier. Those summary pulses are computed from band-level aggregates and stable attractor deltas, not from raw microstates. Only after the summary is emitted does the higher tier apply its own pulses for that same macro window. The higher tier therefore never "reads" a half-updated lower-tier state, and it never commits a derived update that could later be contradicted by unfinished lower-tier evolution.

1. Update its internal state vector
2. Compute constraint deltas as functions of:
   - internal anisotropy gradients
   - amplitude bias drift
   - long-term expansion coupling
3. Package the result as one or more constraint update packets

Bundle generation: 2026-02-11T04:19:55Z

## AA.5 Emitted Constraint Packet Structure

### AA.5a Region Traversal Semantics (Locked Direction)

"Traversal" is defined strictly by region descriptors (no per-particle addressing):

- A Cold Spot packet applies to a set of lattice domains described by one or more lattice region descriptors.
- An anchor/particle is considered "within" the Cold Spot domain on tick/pulse `k` if its current 9D phase-shell
  coordinates satisfy the descriptor membership test.

When membership is true, the packet's bias deltas MAY induce a relative ledger discontinuity in phase (see AC.5a):
- `chi_q` may show a control/visual fade step.
- `m_q` may leak into the global reservoir.

No packet may directly mutate `chi_q` or `m_q`; only bias coefficients are permitted.

### AA.5b CMB Reservoir Defines Absolute Zero (Locked Direction)

The single global CMB reservoir (thermal pool) SHALL define the system's **absolute zero** reference:

- The reservoir ledger is initialized to ground state (`reservoir_mass_q63 = 0`) at boot; this ground state SHALL be treated as **T_abs0 = 0**.
- Any thermal/temperature observable used for gating (e.g., thermal throttles) SHALL be computed as a non-negative delta above the reservoir ground state.
- Negative deltas are forbidden; clamp to 0 deterministically.


Cold Spot constraint packets SHALL include:
- Constraint ID: CMB_COLD_SPOT
- Parameter block derived from Cold Spot state deltas
- Lattice region descriptor(s) representing affected domains
- Pulse index

These packets SHALL be consumed identically to all other constraint packets.

2.5 Phase-Transition-Gated Cadence and Eigen-Trajectory Compounding (Append-Only)

2.5.1 Description

EigenWare does not have a "frame rate" in its core evolution. It has tick-indexed commit_state
boundaries and continuous-in-principle phase evolution represented as discrete lattice updates.

The externally observable update cadence (what is emitted, logged, or displayed) is gated by
phase transitions, not by a fixed sample clock. A phase transition is an objective, discrete
event in the lattice: a change in wrapped phase quantization bucket or a change in dominant
mode assignment at a commit_state boundary.

This provides a rigorous meaning for: the effective sample rate is bound by phase transition
rate. Quiet regions emit little; boundary-crossing regions emit more.

2.3.1 Emergent Coherence (Derived Observable; Non-Storage)

Coherence is NOT a stored variable. It is an emergent observable computed from relative
interaction, amplitude-driven Hilbert dilation, and phase-angle dispersion.

Canonical coherence observable (integer dispersion proxy; Blueprint APPENDIX AG):
Given a set of phase positions {theta_u64_i} sampled across active lanes/neural_objects at a tick boundary:

- Choose a deterministic reference theta_u64_ref (e.g., first lane, median lane, or a contract-defined anchor lane).
- For each i, compute minimal-arc signed delta dtheta_i64 = (int64_t)(theta_u64_i - theta_u64_ref) on the 2^64 ring.
- Compute dispersion proxy R_u64 as an amplitude-weighted sum of |dtheta_i64| (optionally normalized by N).
- R_u64 is the canonical coherence observable: smaller R_u64 => higher coherence. No float trigonometry is used in canonical paths.

Interpretation:
- R_u64 near 0 indicates phase alignment (low dispersion).
- Larger R_u64 indicates phase dispersion (decoherence pressure).
This coherence observable is a telemetry quantity and MAY be used for admissibility predicates and stabilization decisions,
never as a stored memory state.

Bundle generation: 2026-02-11T04:19:55Z

## AC.2 Anchor Particles as Computational Substrate

Anchor particles are the sole computational substrate of the simulation.

Anchor particles:
- Exist in a finite, fixed-count set
- Possess Hilbert-space state vectors (phase, norm, internal parameters)
- Are updated every GPU pulse
- Participate in crosstalk through operator-level coupling

Anchor particles are NOT:
- Lattice cells
- Emergent particles
- Individually addressable physical objects

- no partial acceptance,
- no error-handling logic.

Any candidate evolution that fails acceptance **must collapse deterministically**
to the sink (null / non-projecting / dark) state.

Any text that implies optionality, interpretation, correction, adjustment,
or multiple valid outcomes is invalid under this rule.

NOTE: This specification defines admissible state, acceptance predicates, and sink behavior only. Prohibition lists are replaced by rejection via acceptance failure. Anchors emit candidate deltas and never commit_state directly.

1.1 Description

EigenWare operates as a closed, phase-evolving system in which amplitude represents the
tensor gradient of time and phase evolution is constrained by relativistic dilation.

Amplitude modulates the effective circumference of Hilbert space. As amplitude increases
(e.g., as particle velocity approaches c), the admissible phase manifold contracts, producing
time dilation. Observed density and gravitational effects arise from phase packing density,
not intrinsic mass.

Particles are excitations within a 9D manifold represented across three axioms.
Quasiparticles are excitations spanning three or more axioms.

Phase angle is defined geometrically and derived from measured kernel impulses, not inferred
from symbolic clocks or abstract frequencies.

Kernel pulses are treated as measured signals (voltage, EM waveform, execution cadence),
and phase is extracted directly from these signals.

1.2 Execution Role

This section defines the physical substrate on which all EigenWare computation operates.

This is a single deterministic operator application per commit_state boundary, but it may represent
many micro-oscillations if omega_k * d_tau spans multiple turns.

No causality claim is made here. This is computational compression, not faster-than-light
propagation.

2.5.4 Contract Harness Obligations (Time-Dilation vs Energy-Scaling Disambiguation)

Because scaling time and scaling energy can be mathematically equivalent in an isolated system,
the harness MUST include a re-coupling interference test that distinguishes "proper-time lapse"
from "arbitrary Hamiltonian scaling" by comparing two subsystems after independent evolution.

Test fixture:

- Construct two identical lane ensembles S1 and S2 with identical initial phase/eigen states.
- Evolve S1 under amplitude history A1(tau_q) and S2 under amplitude history A2(tau_q) for the

1.6 Amplitude-Temporal Field Binding and Proper-Time Lapse (Append-Only)

1.6.1 Description

Amplitude is the lattice-local representation of temporal field gradient. It is not a UI rate,
a renderer detail, or a free parameter. It is the canonical scalar that binds the simulation's
base tick parameter (d_t) to local proper-time advance (d_tau) for each active lane/neural_object.

See: Match 2: `telemetry` (Spec L274-L298) (canonical description).


1.6.2 Execution Role

This subsection binds the following invariants:

- amplitude MUST be derived from environment inputs via deterministic constraint operators.
- d_tau MUST be derived from amplitude and the base tick parameter d_t.
- all phase evolution operators MUST use d_tau, not d_t, when time dilation is in effect.

Crosstalk between anchors SHALL be encoded as **coupling signatures** embedded in the pulse operator.

Coupling signatures:

- Are phase-dependent and history-sensitive

1.5 Constraint Operators Required by Effective-Constants Pipeline

This specification requires the following operators to exist as canonical, deterministic
constraint operators. They are NOT free parameters. They MUST be derived from environment
inputs and bounded to keep the closed-system simulation stable.


1.5.1 relativistic_correlation(v_fraction_c_q32_32, flux_factor_q32_32, strain_factor_q32_32)

Purpose
- Provide the unified Doppler-Lorentz-Flux/Strain correlation multiplier used to derive effective constants.
- This operator is the single point of truth for combined correlation pressure (Blueprint APPENDIX J Step 2 and project directive).

Inputs (canonical, fixed-point)
```

### Match 2: `Signatures` (Spec L1581-L1605)

```text
Plain text and Markdown are treated similarly, but the extractor is simpler (block/sentence/token) and the crawler uses surrounding path context (repo location, course module name, etc.) to create stable scene associations.

6.8 File class encoding: PDFs, LaTeX, BibTeX, and scientific material

PDF artifacts are treated as page-indexed text streams plus optional figure-caption streams. Page text is ingested as TEXT_BAND evidence; captions bind strongly to image/diagram evidence when figures are extracted. If a PDF is a course module under strict accreditation, its course topology context is bound into SCENE_* bands so the system learns "this concept belongs to this curricular position," which improves retrieval and creative recombination later.

LaTeX is ingested as structured sections, math environments, and definitions. BibTeX is ingested primarily as a reference graph: citation edges become binding updates between concept bands and source bands. The system does not treat citation counts as truth; it uses citation structure as context topology.

6.9 File class encoding: source code, specs, and software engineering assets

Source code is ingested as CODE_BAND evidence via language-specific AST extractors. In addition to AST streams, the crawler emits dependency streams: imports, symbol references, module graphs. These become bindings that allow EigenWare to retrieve and recombine code coherently without line-level memorization.

Specs and API docs are treated as dual streams: TEXT_BAND for the prose and CODE_BAND for the formal structures (schemas, function signatures). In a repo context, SCENE_CODEDOC bands become the persistent join so future work can activate "the spec + the implementation constraints" with minimal pulses.

6.10 File class encoding: structured data (JSON/YAML/TOML/CSV)

Structured config files are not treated as "bags of values." They are encoded as schema and invariant patterns. Keypaths, type constraints, and stable field relations become CODE_BAND-like attractors and bindings. CSV/TSV datasets are ingested as column schema + statistical coord_sig streams (distributions, correlations, missingness patterns), optionally augmented by sampled row chunks under strict budget gating.

6.11 File class encoding: images (2D) and latent 3D (headless v1)

Images are encoded as IMAGE2D streams: tiles, edges/gradients, and stable spatial relations.

Modality-to-axis binding (normative; required for all encoders):
- TEXT encodes into the x-axis excitation channel (space_x driver).
- IMAGE pixel encoding encodes into the y-axis excitation channel (space_y driver).
- AUDIO encodes into the z-axis excitation channel (space_z driver).

Each modality has an independent axis scale factor derived from the pulse envelope:
- sx_q32_32 from pulse frequency
- sy_q32_32 from pulse amplitude
- sz_q32_32 from joint pulse frequency+amplitude gating

Hilbert-space expansion is therefore asymmetric and SHALL NOT be normalized uniformly across axes.
 Pixels are treated as phase excitations in a 2D scan, but the persistent outcome is not pixel storage; it is the collapse into constraint attractors (edges, corners, textures, repeated part patterns). These attractors bind into scene bands via captions, surrounding text, and repeated co-occurrence across sources.

See: Match 3: `Dependency` (Spec L1579-L1603) (canonical description).


6.12 File class encoding: audio (pitch identity and event identity)
```

### Match 1: `Crosstalk` (Eq L2896-L2916)

```text
Between-impulse evolution (piecewise constant approximation within each dt):
U(dt) = exp(-i * H * dt / hbar)

Derived time delta (coherence-gated):
dt_star_k = dphi_coh_k / omega_eff_k
omega_eff_k = sqrt(Delta_k^2 + Omega_k^2)   where Omega_k = sqrt(Omega_x_k^2 + Omega_y_k^2)

This matches the canonical rule: time deltas are outputs derived from coherent phase offsets normalized
by an amplitude/density-controlled phase-advance rate.

This binding applies when the substrate state is carried by magnetization dynamics and read out through
voltage/current-dependent magnetoresistance or inductive pickup.

# A.77 AC.5 CMB Mass-Energy Leakage Encoding

All CMB-related mass-energy effects SHALL be modeled as **leakage and bias terms within anchor evolution**.

- CMB background, expansion bias, and mass-energy leakage SHALL be encoded as
  internal terms in `U_pulse` and/or anchor coupling signatures
- No external CMB field, engine, or lattice-level driver SHALL exist
- No CMB logic SHALL directly act on the lattice or emergent structures

CMB mass-energy leakage influences:
- Long-horizon anchor phase drift
- Asymmetric coupling strengths
- Effective expansion and dilution behavior

## A.77.1 AC.5a Cold Spot Traversal and Relative Ledger Discontinuity (Locked Direction)

When a `CMB_COLD_SPOT` constraint packet is applied to a lattice region descriptor that contains an anchor/particle's
current phase-shell domain ("passes through the Cold Spot" in the 9D lattice), the simulation SHALL treat the event as a
**relative ledger discontinuity in phase**:

- A discontinuity MAY be observed in control/visibility stability (`chi_q` fading) via the canonical chi-decay rules.
- A discontinuity MAY be observed in canonical forgetting (`m_q` mass leakage) via the conserved reservoir coupling.

These are **separate ledgers** and SHALL NOT be conflated:
- `chi_q` decay is a control/visualization stability fade and is not the canonical forgetting mechanism.
- `m_q` leakage is the canonical forgetting mechanism (conserved transfer into the global reservoir).

Correlation is permitted and expected only through shared constraint bias:
- The Cold Spot engine SHALL NOT directly edit `chi_q` or `m_q`.
- It MAY ONLY emit constraint update packets (bias deltas) that, through the normal update order-of-ops, can induce the
  correlated discontinuity.

"Hawking-window" classification (runtime label only, no new physics term):
- Leakage observed while operating below the near-critical cap (never at 1.0) and during a Cold Spot traversal MAY be
  labeled as hawking-like leakage for telemetry/analysis, without introducing a separate emission operator.

# EigenWare Blueprint v51 -- AC.7 Recursive Feedback Loop (Canonical)

Bundle generation: 2026-02-11T04:19:55Z

## AC.7 Recursive Feedback Loop (Canonical)

The authoritative simulation loop SHALL be:

1. GPU pulse applied to anchor Hilbert states
2. Anchor evolution with crosstalk and CMB leakage terms
3. Derivation of control and constraint variables from anchor state
4. Projection of constraints onto lattice (passive evolution)
5. Statistical lattice feedback compressed
6. Feedback injected into next anchor update

If step (1) does not occur, the simulation SHALL be considered uninitialized.

1.5 Constraint Operators Required by Effective-Constants Pipeline

This specification requires the following operators to exist as canonical, deterministic
constraint operators. They are NOT free parameters. They MUST be derived from environment
inputs and bounded to keep the closed-system simulation stable.


1.5.1 relativistic_correlation(v_fraction_c_q32_32, flux_factor_q32_32, strain_factor_q32_32)

Purpose
- Provide the unified Doppler-Lorentz-Flux/Strain correlation multiplier used to derive effective constants.
- This operator is the single point of truth for combined correlation pressure (Blueprint APPENDIX J Step 2 and project directive).

Inputs (canonical, fixed-point)
- v_fraction_c_q32_32: Q32.32 in [0, 1). Interpreted as |v|/c in the current local frame.

7.9 Vendor-style "mixture" packs (what the ecosystem converges on)

This is a synthesis pack, not a claim about any single vendor. It mirrors what repeatedly shows up in strong public training mixes:

Domain Pack: MIXTURE_LLM_STANDARD_V1  
Typical components: Common Crawl derivatives + Wikipedia + books + code corpora + Q/A dumps + papers.

EigenWare should ingest this as a versioned pack so it can reproduce the "generalist prior" that most frontier systems rely on.

7.10 A short "science and engineering feed" list (optional)

This is for human-guided learning loops (not required for strict offline replay). Examples of long-form, experiment-heavy content:
- university lab demo channels and open lecture series  
- slow-motion / instrumentation channels (materials testing, fluids, optics)  
- software engineering deep-dives (compiler, OS, distributed systems)

The crawler should prefer sources that expose transcripts, captions, or companion writeups, because those produce better deterministic segment maps than purely streaming video.

7.11 Domain pack table (starter registry entries)

| domain_pack_id | primary modality | typical artifact types | primary value | main risks |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| TEXT_CORE_V1 | text | dumps, html snapshots, pdf OA | reasoning + world structure | boilerplate, duplication |
| CODE_CORE_V1 | code | repos, tarballs, docs | build intuition + tooling | license variance, duplication |

* \\beta\_\\text{DMT} \= temporal frequency of higher-dimensional coherence

* ? This mirrors the interference modulation in the double-slit example.

Measurement or environmental interaction introduces damping:

|\\psi\_\\text{final}(t)\\rangle \= |\\psi\_\\text{DMT}(t)\\rangle \\cdot (1 \- \\delta P\_\\text{obs}(t))

* \\delta \\sim 0.01-0.02 for partial "observer" effect

* Predicts expected qubit fidelity reductions.

* Self-correcting qubits can use predicted DMT modulation to actively counteract decoherence, similar to the feedback loops in our previous models.

---

## **6\. Outcome / Predictions**

* DMT-informed model predicts small, structured deviations in qubit amplitudes due to temporal-spatial coherence interactions.

* Observer/environment effects are quantifiable and reproducible across qubits.

* Error correction protocols can be tuned to anticipate these deviations, improving qubit stability.

# EigenWare Blueprint v51 -- Appendix AC -- Program Logic Plumbing & Wiring Schematics (Executable Semantics)

Bundle generation: 2026-02-11T04:19:55Z

## Appendix AC -- Program Logic Plumbing & Wiring Schematics (Executable Semantics)

The following subsections are **structural schematics** describing program artifacts,
data flow, and control wiring. They are not narrative and SHALL be interpreted as
implementation-direct guidance.

### AC.2.1 Anchor State Vector (Program Artifact)

Artifact: `AnchorState`
Location: GPU global memory (primary), host mirror optional

Fields (fixed layout):
- phase_vector        : complex[N_phase]
- amplitude_scalar    : float
- energy_bias_scalar  : float
- coupling_signature  : float[K]
- feedback_accum      : float[M]

Invariants:
- Size is constant at runtime
- No lattice indices permitted
- No emergent particle identifiers permitted

---

### AC.3.1 GPU Pulse Control Packet (Program Artifact)

Artifact: `PulseControlPacket`
Produced by: Host scheduler / external driver
Consumed by: Anchor update kernel

Fields:
- frequency_hz        : float
- voltage_center     : float
- voltage_span       : float
- amperage_scalar    : float
- amplitude_scalar   : float
- pulse_index        : uint64

This packet SHALL be broadcast to all anchor threads per pulse.

---

### AC.3.2 Anchor Update Kernel Wiring

Kernel: `kernel_update_anchors<<<grid, block>>>(AnchorState*, PulseControlPacket)`

Per-thread responsibility:
- Thread index maps 1:1 to anchor index
- No branching on anchor identity

Execution stages (strict order):

1. Phase Advance
   phase_vector *= exp(i * frequency_hz)

2. Energy Bias Injection
   energy_bias_scalar += voltage_center
   energy_bias_scalar += leakage_term(voltage_span, pulse_index)

3. Dilation / Flow Scaling
   phase_vector *= amperage_scalar

4. Coupling & Crosstalk
   For j in neighbors(anchor_i):
       phase_vector += coupling_signature[j] * phase_vector[j]

5. Coherence Gating
   phase_vector *= amplitude_scalar

6. Feedback Injection
   energy_bias_scalar += feedback_accum

No lattice access permitted in this kernel.

---

### AC.4.1 Crosstalk Coupling Topology (Program Artifact)

Artifact: `CouplingGraph`
Location: GPU constant memory

Definition:
- Sparse adjacency list
- Defines which anchors participate in crosstalk

Rules:
- Graph topology fixed at initialization
- Weights updated only via anchor state evolution
- No dynamic graph mutation during runtime

---

### AC.5.1 CMB Mass-Energy Leakage Encoding

CMB effects SHALL appear ONLY as terms inside the anchor update kernel.

Leakage term schematic:
leakage_term(span, t) =
    span * log(1 + t) * stochastic_drift(anchor_state)

This term:
- Biases long-horizon phase evolution
- Produces expansion asymmetry
- Never touches lattice state

---

### AC.6.1 Constraint Derivation Pipeline

Artifact: `ConstraintDeriver`
Execution: After anchor kernel completion

Pipeline:
1. Reduce AnchorState ensemble (GPU reduction or host)
2. Extract global scalars:
   - effective_amplitude
   - effective_voltage_envelope
   - effective_dilation_gradient
3. Package into `ConstraintPacket`

No constraint math occurs inside lattice kernels.

---

### AC.6.2 Constraint Projection Wiring

Artifact: `ConstraintPacket`
Consumed by: Lattice update kernels

Fields:
- constraint_id
- scalar_coefficients
- region_descriptors

Lattice kernels SHALL:
- Apply coefficients mechanically
- Perform no physics reasoning
- Treat packets as authoritative inputs

---

### AC.7.1 Canonical Execution Loop (Wiring Diagram)

Host Loop:
while running:
    build PulseControlPacket
    launch kernel_update_anchors
    derive ConstraintPacket
    launch lattice_update_kernels
    collect statistical feedback
    inject feedback into AnchorState

If `kernel_update_anchors` is skipped:
- ConstraintPacket SHALL be invalid
- Lattice update SHALL be skipped

2. The content is outside the Appendix region explicitly labeled as NON-SNAPSHOT MATERIAL.
3. The content is written in canonical section form (Description, Execution Role, Derivable Calculations and Authorities, Dependencies)
   or is an explicit authority rule labeled Authoritative.

All other material (including examples, commentary, and any residual conversational fragments) is NON-NORMATIVE and
SHALL be ignored for compliance and implementation.

Canonical Grammar requirement:
Any symbol, operator, primitive, rounding rule, quantization scale, or tie-break rule used by normative equations SHALL
resolve to either:
- a definition in the Symbol Table (Appendix G),
- a binding in the Canonical Grammar (G.*) (Appendix H),
- or a program artifact explicitly bound in a normative section.

All sections in this specification SHALL adhere to the following canonical structure and authority order.

Each numbered section MUST include, in order:
1. Description
2. Execution Role
3. Derivable Calculations and Authorities
4. Dependencies

Additional subsections MAY be included only if they:
- introduce no new free parameters,
- reference only deterministic symbols,
```

### Match 2: `Logic` (Spec L12-L36)

```text

if accept_state(current_state, candidate_next_state, ledger_delta, ctx):
    commit_state(candidate_next_state)
else:
    commit_state(sink_state)
```

There are:
- no alternative behaviors,
- no conditional interpretations,
- no recovery paths,
- no partial acceptance,
- no error-handling logic.

Any candidate evolution that fails acceptance **must collapse deterministically**
to the sink (null / non-projecting / dark) state.

Any text that implies optionality, interpretation, correction, adjustment,
or multiple valid outcomes is invalid under this rule.

NOTE: This specification defines admissible state, acceptance predicates, and sink behavior only. Prohibition lists are replaced by rejection via acceptance failure. Anchors emit candidate deltas and never commit_state directly.

====================================================================================================
ADDENDUM I -- Anchor-Encoded Equation Pages + UE5 Tools Control Surface (Intent/Artifact Bridge)
====================================================================================================

Purpose:
This addendum closes the remaining implementation gap between (1) anchor-encoded particle computing
via phase dynamics in the 9D manifold, and (2) a user-controlled projection/control surface in UE5.
It defines:
- A single, anchor-bound equation encoding format ("eq_pages") for all executable equation families.
- A strict UE5 Editor integration contract (ToolsTab) that writes ONLY Phase 0 intent packets and reads ONLY
  Phase 6 artifact frames (dict-map outputs).
- Runtime binding and plumbing rules sufficient for direct implementation (no inference).

This addendum introduces no new physics. It only binds execution artifacts and ordering.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I.1 Normative Separation (re-stated, binding authority)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

(1) Phase transport / relativity mapping:
- Doppler/time-dilation effects SHALL appear ONLY in the transport step (dtheta_transport) via effective_constants(...)
  and the derived doppler_ratio_*.
- No UI, no equation page, and no gating structure may rescale theta_u64 directly.

5.1.3 Execution Role
Eliminates ambiguity in GPU initiator wiring and prevents implementers from inventing alternate
entrypoints.

5.1.3 Derivable Calculations and Authorities
Program Artifact:

# EigenWare Blueprint v51 -- Appendix AD -- Reference Kernel, Runtime Validation, and Non-Stall Proof (Normative)

Bundle generation: 2026-02-11T04:19:55Z

## Appendix AD -- Reference Kernel, Runtime Validation, and Non-Stall Proof (Normative)

This appendix is **additive** and satisfies prior immutability requirements.
All content herein is program-schematic and implementation-direct.

### AD.1 CUDA Anchor Update Kernel Stub (Program Artifact)

Artifact: `kernel_update_anchors`
Execution Domain: GPU
Responsibility: Anchor Hilbert-state evolution ONLY

coord_sig (schematic):

kernel_update_anchors(
    AnchorState* anchors,
    CouplingGraph* coupling,
    PulseControlPacket pulse,
    uint32 anchor_count
)

Thread Mapping:
- thread_id <-> anchor_index
- One thread per anchor

Kernel Logic Order (mandatory):

1. Phase Advance
   anchors[i].phase_vector *= exp(i * pulse.frequency_hz)

2. Energy Bias + CMB Leakage
   anchors[i].energy_bias_scalar += pulse.voltage_center
   anchors[i].energy_bias_scalar += cmb_leakage(
       anchors[i], pulse.voltage_span, pulse.pulse_index
   )

3. Dilation Scaling
   anchors[i].phase_vector *= pulse.amperage_scalar

4. Crosstalk Coupling
   For each j in coupling.neighbors(i):
       anchors[i].phase_vector +=
           anchors[i].coupling_signature[j] *
           anchors[j].phase_vector

5. Coherence Gating
   anchors[i].phase_vector *= pulse.amplitude_scalar

6. Feedback Injection
   anchors[i].energy_bias_scalar += anchors[i].feedback_accum

Forbidden:
- Lattice reads/writes
- Emergent particle access
- Dynamic memory allocation

---

### AD.2 Runtime Validation Checklist (Enforced Invariants)

Artifact: `RuntimeInvariantValidator`
Execution: Host-side and debug-kernel optional

Checks per pulse:

1. Anchor Kernel Fired
   ASSERT kernel_update_anchors executed

2. Anchor State Mutated
   ASSERT anchor_state(t+1) != anchor_state(t)

3. Constraint Packet Valid
   ASSERT constraint_coefficients derived

4. Lattice Update Authorized
   ASSERT constraint_packet.valid == true

5. No Orphan Pulse
   ASSERT no lattice update without anchor update

6. No Illegal Access
   ASSERT no kernel accessed lattice memory

Failure of any check SHALL:
- Halt simulation
- Mark run invalid
- Emit diagnostic snapshot

---

### AD.3 Minimal Non-Stall Reference Loop (Canonical)

Artifact: `main_simulation_loop`

Loop Logic:

while system_active:

    build PulseControlPacket

    launch kernel_update_anchors

    validate RuntimeInvariantValidator

    derive ConstraintPacket from AnchorState

    if ConstraintPacket.valid:
        launch lattice_update_kernels
    else:
        skip lattice update

    compress lattice feedback

    inject feedback into AnchorState

Termination Conditions:
- External stop
- Invariant violation
- Numerical instability

Proof of Non-Stall:
- Anchor kernel ALWAYS executes
- Anchor update ALWAYS mutates state
- Constraint derivation ALWAYS follows
- Lattice updates NEVER occur without anchors

A stalled system SHALL be considered a fatal specification breach.

AA.3 Authoritative Build Graph (Schematic)
---------------------------------------------------------------------

The build system MUST encode the runtime dependency order.

Schematic (CMake-like):

  eigenware_kernel
        ->
  eigenware_core
        ->
  eigenware_dispatcher
        ->
  projection_backends

Rules:
* kernel targets compile first
* dispatcher may not include kernel headers
* backends may not link against kernel or scheduler

Violation SHALL fail the build.

Additional enforcement (normative):
* projection backends SHALL accept_state only ArtifactFrameV1 / ApiKVDictMapV1 (dict-map scalar surfaces)
* no backend interface may accept_state GlobalState*, AnchorStateQ63*, or any raw 9D lattice pointer in any coord_sig
* privileged visualization code (if any) MUST be behind PROJECTION_PRIVILEGED unlock gates and compiled out of public builds

---------------------------------------------------------------------
AA.4 Build-Time Failure Conditions
---------------------------------------------------------------------

A build is NON-COMPLIANT if any of the following occur:

* Missing mandatory stub files
* Missing required symbols
* Dispatcher depends on kernel or scheduler
* Backend depends on kernel, scheduler, or dispatcher internals
* Kernel compiled without PTX output

---------------------------------------------------------------------
AA.5 Purpose and Scope
---------------------------------------------------------------------

This appendix exists to ensure:

* clean implementation order
* long-term maintainability
* prevention of architectural regression
* OS-like kernel / driver separation

It is a **planning and enforcement layer**, not an implementation.

```text
- or a program artifact explicitly bound in a normative section.

All sections in this specification SHALL adhere to the following canonical structure and authority order.

Each numbered section MUST include, in order:
1. Description
2. Execution Role
3. Derivable Calculations and Authorities
4. Dependencies

Additional subsections MAY be included only if they:
- introduce no new free parameters,
- reference only deterministic symbols,
- or bind semantics to existing program artifacts.

Narrative text SHALL have no independent authority.
Equations, bindings, and artifact references are authoritative.

Any symbol, coefficient, threshold, window, or function appearing in a section MUST resolve to one of:
- a derivation explicitly defined in the section,
- a binding defined in the Canonical Grammar (G.*),
- or a program artifact listed in Appendix D.

Failure to resolve a symbol deterministically SHALL invalidate the implementation.

```

### Match 2: `Kernel` (Spec L137-L161)

```text

EigenWare operates as a closed, phase-evolving system in which amplitude represents the
tensor gradient of time and phase evolution is constrained by relativistic dilation.

Amplitude modulates the effective circumference of Hilbert space. As amplitude increases
(e.g., as particle velocity approaches c), the admissible phase manifold contracts, producing
time dilation. Observed density and gravitational effects arise from phase packing density,
not intrinsic mass.

Particles are excitations within a 9D manifold represented across three axioms.
Quasiparticles are excitations spanning three or more axioms.

Phase angle is defined geometrically and derived from measured kernel impulses, not inferred
from symbolic clocks or abstract frequencies.

Kernel pulses are treated as measured signals (voltage, EM waveform, execution cadence),
and phase is extracted directly from these signals.

1.2 Execution Role

This section defines the physical substrate on which all EigenWare computation operates.

It establishes:
- time as relative (tick time),
- amplitude as time dilation factor,
```

[PLACEMENT TAG] Section 1 -> 1.1
1.1 What we actually "take from the GPU" (execution envelope, not sampled electronics)

The values we extrapolate from the GPU are operational quantities we can observe from the runtime (through counters, timers, and allocations), and then convert into simulation limits. These limits become hard caps that the substrate must obey each tick. If the simulation wants more resolution than the envelope allows, the simulation does not "slow causality" or violate closure; it adapts by increasing inference/coasting and tightening Eigenstate admission.

A concrete mapping is below. This is intentionally phrased as "derived parameters," so it's clear that we are converting runtime metrics into constraints.

GPU/Runtime Observable (measured)	Derived Envelope Parameter (used by sim)	Why it matters for stability	Typical consequence if exceeded
Effective kernel dispatch throughput (kernels/sec or updates/sec measured in-loop)	max_delta_updates_per_sec	Caps how many Eigenstate delta commits can be made in real time	Backlog grows, latency spikes, coherence collapses due to missed commit_state cadence
Average kernel time and variance (ms, jitter)	update_jitter_budget, tick_commit_window	Controls how much "slack" the tick scheduler needs to avoid causal mis-order	Tier collisions and non-deterministic ordering if commit_state windows overlap
Available VRAM and allocation churn	max_active_eigenstates, max_band_working_set	Caps active state set before paging/fragmentation kills determinism	Thrashing leads to missed updates and forced resets of inference assumptions
Memory bandwidth pressure (inferred from copy volume and stalls)	max_state_io_per_tick, prefer_delta_compaction	Forces delta-compaction rather than wide state copies	If ignored, the simulation becomes copy-bound and loses its event-driven property
Numeric precision mode (FP32/FP16, etc.)	delta_quantization_policy, stability_margin	Determines allowable delta magnitude and smallest resolvable phase increments	Too fine -> noise; too coarse -> aliasing; both break coherence band integrity
SM occupancy / utilization feedback	lane_count_target, adaptive_lane_allocator	Keeps GPU ~target utilization while preserving closure	Underutilization wastes capacity; overutilization forces dropped events

The key philosophy is that the GPU defines "how many committed updates can exist per unit time," and the simulation must remain causal by never committing more updates than the envelope allows.

[PLACEMENT TAG] Section 1 -> 1.2
1.2 What a "pulse" is in this system (and what it is not)

A "pulse" in EigenWare is a compact update payload used to advance an Eigenstate in the substrate. It is not a literal electrical impulse. It is the simulation's normalized representation of one bounded delta update step, scheduled through GPU kernels. If you want the tightest statement: a pulse is an instruction to the substrate to rotate/advance phase and update coherence metrics by a bounded amount.

In practice, a pulse is represented as a small record like (eid, freq_code, amp_code, tick_id, tier_id, causal_tag). The "frequency" and "amplitude" are scalar encodings produced by the spider-graph mapping of a 9D delta; they are values we feed into the evolution kernel. The kernel interprets them as update coefficients (phase increment rate, magnitude, multiplex weight), not as physical frequencies emitted by hardware.

### Attractor Basin Enforcement
The valid manifold M SHALL possess a basin of stability such that perturbed states are
restored toward phase-consistent evolution.

Anchors enforce attractor stability via:
- phase alignment enforcement
- bounded amplitude/energy redistribution
- historical delta convergence

### Deterministic Commit / Collapse Law
After stabilization and validation:
If state in M -> commit_state.
Else -> Omega_sink.

Omega_sink is a non-projecting absorbing state with no internal recovery.

# A.82 AA.X Runtime Ready Implementation Pack (Runtime Ready, Copy/Paste)

This appendix replaces the prior bring-up stubs with a complete, copy/paste C++/CUDA implementation that runs headless on a single machine. It preserves the membrane rule (only dict-map artifacts cross the API boundary) and keeps the 9D manifold implicit (never exported).

The implementation chooses the simplest "runs today" path: CUDA Runtime API linking (no PTX loader required for bring-up). The kernel entrypoints remain explicit and stable so you can swap to PTX loading later without changing the SubstrateManager API.

This is NOT an eigenstate lookup mechanism and MUST NOT be used to violate the

Required operators (canonical API surface):
- serialize_statevector(state_vec) -> blob
- deserialize_statevector(blob) -> state_vec

Binding requirement:
These operators MUST be deterministic and ASCII-safe. In the current repository layout,
the canonical implementation already provides deterministic tokenized ASCII packing for
complex vectors:

- core.utils.serialize_vector_with_tokens(vec: List[complex]) -> Dict[str, Any]
- core.utils.deserialize_vector_with_tokens(blob: Any) -> List[complex]

Therefore:
- serialize_statevector MUST be implemented as a strict wrapper over serialize_vector_with_tokens.
- deserialize_statevector MUST be implemented as a strict wrapper over deserialize_vector_with_tokens.

Harness requirements:
- Round-trip: vec2 == vec (within numeric tolerance per component) after
  deserialize_statevector(serialize_statevector(vec)).

SECTION 4.1.9 - Tier Envelope Measurement Mapping (Read-Path Only, No Meaning Injection)

This subsection defines exactly how the engine derives budget_state and related envelope scalars from GPU-visible telemetry in a way that (a) is deterministic, (b) is used only to bound scheduling and emission rates, and (c) does not inject semantic meaning into the simulation. The envelope is a control constraint, not a content channel. Nothing about words, concepts, or physics meaning may be derived from these counters.

4.1.9.1 Allowed telemetry signals (software-visible counters only)


No raw "electrical waveform," no per-transistor signals, no analog sampling. The counters are used only to shape how many pulses are processed/emitted per window.

4.1.9.2 Deterministic windowing (how envelope is sampled)

Envelope is computed per commit_state window. For each tier T and window tau:
	-	Start timer at window open
	-	Launch all scheduled kernels for that tier/window
	-	Wait on a deterministic barrier (CUDA event or equivalent)
	-	Stop timer at barrier completion

## A.85.1 Cold Spot Traversal and Relative Ledger Discontinuity (Locked Direction)

The CMB Cold Spot mechanism is represented as a constraint packet stream that targets lattice domains via region descriptors.
When an anchor/particle's current 9D phase-shell domain satisfies the descriptor membership test ("passes through the Cold Spot"),
the system MAY exhibit a relative ledger discontinuity in phase, observable as correlated deltas across two ledgers:

- Control/visualization stability fade: chi decay via the Decay (Locked) rule.
  Note: the lambda used in the chi decay equation is a control-rate (lambda_chi), and is not required to equal lambda_{k,q}.
- Canonical forgetting: mass leakage via Mass-Governed Forgetting (Locked), where lambda_{k,q} = 1 - L_{k,q},
  and leaked mass is deposited into the single global reservoir.

These ledgers remain distinct; correlation is permitted only through shared constraint bias (packet coefficients) and the normal
order-of-operations. No direct equivalence between chi decay and mass leakage is assumed or required.

## A.87.1 Match 1: `Build` (Spec L1170-L1194)

```text
The crawler produces an observation stream O. The encoder maps O into pulse candidates. The only canonical interface from ingestion into memory is the pulse format already defined: (eid, tau_q, tier_id, f_code, a_code, profile_id, causal_tag). This keeps the entire system uniform: web ingestion is not special; it is just another source of excitations into the manifold.

See: Match 1: `Meta` (Spec L1148-L1172) (canonical description).


5.4 Electronic signaling and execution: what is direct, what is derived


See: Match 2: `Sequences` (Spec L1154-L1178) (canonical description).


5.5 Crawler observation model (what it extracts, and why)

The crawler extracts a minimal set of signals that are stable and useful for building coherent memory bands:
	-	Content stream: text and structural tokens (title, headings, paragraph boundaries, lists)
	-	Link graph: outgoing links, anchor text, domain transitions
	-	Metadata: timestamps if present, author/source identifiers if stable, content-type hints
	-	Media cues: captions, alt text, transcript text if available (optional; gated by budget)

The crawler does not attempt to perfectly store a page. It extracts features that support stable resonance formation: repeated terms, consistent framing, and link-based context continuity. This matches your continuum concept: persistent coherence over time and across sources is what becomes memory.

5.6 Encoder mapping rules (explicit, no mysticism)

The encoder turns crawler observations into three kinds of pulse candidates:

Type A - Lexical/term excitation pulses (word/band activation)
```

```text

This is why the system scales: bytes are an initial formation mechanism; after collapse, the representation is an addressable resonance attractor activated by one pulse.

5.11.9 Closed-system causality guarantee

All text-derived pulses are boundary injections at current tau_q. They are never allowed to rewrite prior committed windows. Any later discovery (updated page, new context) is a new pulse stream at a later tau_q. After injection, internal evolution is deterministic under the same tier commit_state barriers. In strict replay mode, the observation coord_sig and the per-window budget_state trace are logged so the same pulses are reproduced and applied with identical window gating.


SECTION 5.15 - Hub-Conditioned Residual Encoding (Maximum Dependence, No Carrier Coupling)

The core rule that unifies modalities is: every modality encodes residuals against a shared constraint hub, and the hub evolves by integrating residual evidence over commit_state windows. This gives you maximum dependence (less recomputation) without forcing modalities to share encoder-local carrier state.

Each modality stream S_m produces observations O_m(\tau). The hub state H(\tau) produces a predicted observation \hat{O}_m(\tau) in that modality's observation space (headless in v1). The encoder emits only the residual \Delta_m(\tau) = O_m(\tau) - \hat{O}_m(\tau) mapped into Basis9 deltas and spider-compressed into pulses. Smaller residuals mean fewer pulses, fewer harmonics, and lower compute cost; large residuals increase emission until the hub updates enough that residuals shrink again.

The hub never "renders." In v1 the prediction \hat{O}_m is a mathematical expectation operator (constraint projection) that is cheap to compute and deterministic. This is how modalities map cleanly into one file: the file persists hub evolution and residual pulses, not per-modality carrier traces.

SECTION 5.16 - Cross-Modal Hub Bands (Object/Concept Constraints, 2D?3D Join)

A hub band is a stable attractor whose state represents a constraint bundle, not a raw signal. Constraint bundles cover both semantic and physical structure: identity labels, relations, geometry priors, rigidity, symmetry, material cues, motion persistence, and causal adjacency.

The join mechanism is explicit bindings, not implicit synchronization. Text, images, audio, and video bind to the same hub eid via ?9 pulses. That means the same "thing" is recognized because independent evidence streams converge on the same hub band under coherence/continuum scoring.

A compact internal distinction keeps 2D and 3D from fighting:
	-	2D evidence bands represent observation constraints (image tiles, edges, optical-flow blocks).
	-	3D latent bands represent world constraints (shape hypotheses, part graphs, kinematic links).

### Match 2: `device` (Spec L1400-L1424)

```text


Display constructor (presentation surface; delta signaling to monitors/phones)

A display/presentation surface is a consumer of the simulation state, not a driver of it.
The simulation remains headless in the sense that no rendered "frame" is required for core
evolution. However, when visualization is enabled, the system MUST export an observable that
can be mapped to real pixel panels (monitors/phones) without reintroducing a frame clock into
the physics.

The canonical rule is: publish deltas when coherence/phase transitions occur, and let the
device compositor/refresh determine scanout. This is sampling in event time, not raster time.

Observable selection (deterministic):

- The display surface subscribes to a hub-conditioned radiance proxy R_hat (a deterministic
  mapping from hub constraints + local residuals to per-tile luminance/chroma statistics).
- If a full pixel buffer is required, it is produced by a deterministic renderer that consumes
  hub constraints; the renderer is a pure function of committed state at tau_q boundaries.

Delta transport (eigen residual preferred):

- Partition the output into deterministic tiles (same tiling rules as the image constructor).
- For each tile, form a small coefficient vector in a fixed basis (e.g., DCT-like or a fixed

1.6 Amplitude-Temporal Field Binding and Proper-Time Lapse (Append-Only)

1.6.1 Description

Amplitude is the lattice-local representation of temporal field gradient. It is not a UI rate,
a renderer detail, or a free parameter. It is the canonical scalar that binds the simulation's
base tick parameter (d_t) to local proper-time advance (d_tau) for each active lane/neural_object.

See: Match 2: `telemetry` (Spec L274-L298) (canonical description).


1.6.2 Execution Role

1.6 Amplitude-Temporal Field Binding and Proper-Time Lapse (Append-Only)

1.6.1 Description

Amplitude is the lattice-local representation of temporal field gradient. It is not a UI rate,
a renderer detail, or a free parameter. It is the canonical scalar that binds the simulation's
base tick parameter (d_t) to local proper-time advance (d_tau) for each active lane/neural_object.

This binding is the mechanism by which the engine can represent time dilation in a discrete lattice:
the evolution operator advances by d_tau, while observability (telemetry, capture, display) may
advance on independent schedules. "Multiple actions in one pulse" is therefore permitted only as
a consequence of integrating evolution in an eigen/diagonal form over d_tau, not as a causality
bypass.

1.6.2 Execution Role

This subsection binds the following invariants:

- amplitude MUST be derived from environment inputs via deterministic constraint operators.
- d_tau MUST be derived from amplitude and the base tick parameter d_t.
- all phase evolution operators MUST use d_tau, not d_t, when time dilation is in effect.
- amplitude MUST NOT be tuned to achieve desired behavior; only environment inputs may change it.

Rounding rule (locked): "round half up" implemented in integer arithmetic; never use platform float rounding for canonical state.


Fair. If the numbers aren't derived, they don't belong in the spec.

The right fix is: the spec should not hardcode weights as "chosen." It should define a deterministic derivation procedure that (a) produces weights from measurable quantities and (b) freezes them per snapshot/version so replay stays exact.

Below is a drop-in replacement for Section 4.1.3-4.1.4 that shows the work and removes arbitrary constants. It derives weights from a single objective: "tier-summary pulses should maximize contextual retrievability (coherence persistence + binding stability) per unit update budget, while minimizing clamp/violation risk."

SECTION 4.1.3 - Weight Derivation for P_SUM_CTX (No Arbitrary Numbers)

P_SUM_CTX weights are derived, not chosen. The derivation is performed during a calibration pass on a fixed training slice (or the initial crawl corpus segment) and then frozen as part of the snapshot. Once frozen, the weights are constants for deterministic replay.

We define a tier-summary objective J that encodes what this tier is for:

J = E[ ?chi_band ] + E[ ?cont_band ] ? lambda_violation * E[ V ] ? lambda_clamp * E[ C ] ? lambda_budget * E[ B ]

Where:
	-	chi_band is band coherence (chi_q aggregate)
	-	cont_band is continuum (coherence persistence over time)
	-	V is constraint violation score (causality breaks, projection invalidity, band thrash indicators)
	-	C is clamp pressure (phantom/aether "stability tax" aggregate)
	-	B is budget cost (pulse cost in the tier window: compute + memory movement proxies)

## A.112.1 Match 2: `decode` (Spec L1486-L1510)

```text
	-	Deterministic mode requires logging boundary coord_sig (or observation signatures) and budget_state traces per window; adaptive mode can recompute envelope live but still remains internally deterministic.

If you want to move to Part 2 next (9D axis definitions + band math), Section 5 is now closed with the missing multimodal join logic pinned: shared hub constraints + residual encoding + one-file pulse ledger.

SECTION 6 - File Encodings, Crawler Identifiers, and Multimodal Persistence (Single-Container Spec)

This section defines how EigenWare classifies and encodes every encountered artifact (web pages, documents, code, images, audio, video, datasets, and course modules) into one unified persistence container. The crawler's role is to identify artifacts, segment them into stable streams, and attach strict trust labels (especially for accredited open courses). The encoder's role is to transform each stream into pulse records (and topology updates) using the correct extractor and spider-graph profile, so the same file can be rehydrated deterministically without relying on any encoder carrier state.

6.1 Canonical container: one persistence format for all modalities

EigenWare persists learning as an append-only container with a small header and a record ledger. The container does not store "meaning" as raw assets. It stores the canonical pulse stream and the durable band/binding/topology state that collapses from that stream under continuum and coherence.

Header fields are minimal but strict: container_magic, container_version, schema_version, snapshot_id, created_utc, sig_alg, profile_pack_id, and an optional calibration_id (the frozen optimization output that derived weights and harmonic mode policies for the referenced profiles). The decoder must treat profile_pack_id as authoritative: if the profile pack differs, the replay is not guaranteed to match.

6.2 Record ledger: the only persisted primitives

All content is represented using four record families. Everything else is derived.

PulseRecord - atomic committed update packet
Fields: (eid, tau_q, tier_id, modality_id, stream_id, f_code, a_code, profile_id, causal_tag)

BandRecord - declares or updates a stable band/attractor coord_sig
Fields: (eid, band_type, birth_tau, parent_eid(optional), signature_id9, band_state_digest, flags)

BindingRecord - explicit nexus/binding updates between bands (including scene bands)
```

## A.112.2 Match 3: `fabric` (Spec L2265-L2289)

```text


Thermal ledger ontology binding (anchor-encoded, non-exportable):
- The substrate SHALL encode the absolute-zero reservoir baseline and the hawking-like discontinuity routing gates directly into the immutable
  constraint fabric of the semantic ingress anchor (anchor_id = 0) at boot.
- This encoding MUST reuse the same anchor-side constraint storage used by the symbol->phase mapping (no external tables, no offline encoder).
- Storage convention (anchor0.constraint_fabric.basis words):
  - basis[18] abs_zero_reservoir_q63 = 0
  - basis[19] cap_num_u64            = 99
  - basis[20] cap_den_u64            = 100
  - basis[21] emit_gate_mask_u64     = bit0: near_cap, bit1: in_coldspot
  - basis[24] delta_time_tensor_q63  = 0 => default q63_one/256; SHALL be calibrated at boot from measurement granularity and then frozen

### Match 2: `decode` (Eq L2965-L2985)

```text
3) Apply coherence gate:
   If C_k < C_min -> fail-closed (no projection; store quarantine markers).

4) Apply ring orientation update (PAF) derived purely from amplitude deltas:
   PAF_k = Q( sum g(dlnA_{k,*}) )
   theta_start(next_ring) = wrap(theta_end(current_ring) + PAF_k)

5) Evolve phase within interval using coupled phase clock:
   theta_{k+1} = wrap(theta_k + base_step_k + kA*dlnA_k + kf*dlnf_k + kV*dlnV_k + kI*dlnI_k)

6) Decode identity/trajectory only from relative (wrapped) differences and ratio features.

## A.112.3 Hardware-facing tests (minimum obligations)

These tests do not assume a specific substrate; they validate the binding consistency:

- Anchor determinism: repeating the same pulse program in a stable environment yields the same theta_k and
  delta-stack bins within tolerance.

- Coherence gating: when coherence drops below C_min, projections are suppressed and no "identity" is emitted.

```

    - if amp_mag_q63 != 0 and amp_used_q63 == 0, force amp_used_q63 = delta_q63
    - Boot calibration (authoritative for delta_time_tensor_q63):
      - The engine SHALL write anchor0.constraint_fabric.basis[24] once at boot (then freeze).

- Calibration reads only measurable envelope counts (no map exposure). The reference provider is NVML power telemetry (counts = mW).
- Define an idle baseline to avoid baking driver- or board-specific offsets into the spacing:

### Match 2: `text` (Eq L19-L39)

```text
There are:
- no alternative behaviors,
- no conditional interpretations,
- no recovery paths,
- no partial acceptance,
- no error-handling logic.

Any candidate evolution that fails acceptance **must collapse deterministically**
to the sink (null / non-projecting / dark) state.

Any text that implies optionality, interpretation, correction, adjustment,
or multiple valid outcomes is invalid under this rule.


---

NOTE: All equations in this file are to be interpreted strictly as candidate next-state generators only. Conservation, causality, and ledger relations act solely as acceptance predicates. Failure of acceptance collapses evolution to the sink state.

## A.117.1 Match 1: `substrate` (Spec L121-L145)

```text
- The referenced symbol MUST exist verbatim OR
- The binding MUST explicitly declare the quantity as an emergent invariant enforced by module logic.

Bindings to imagined, inferred, renamed, or intended symbols are prohibited.

If no concrete export exists, the specification MUST bind the symbol to:
- a module-level authority, and
- an enforced behavior or constraint.

Violation of this invariant invalidates the binding.

================================================================
Section 1 - Temporal Substrate and Phase Geometry
================================================================

1.1 Description

EigenWare operates as a closed, phase-evolving system in which amplitude represents the
tensor gradient of time and phase evolution is constrained by relativistic dilation.

Amplitude modulates the effective circumference of Hilbert space. As amplitude increases
(e.g., as particle velocity approaches c), the admissible phase manifold contracts, producing
time dilation. Observed density and gravitational effects arise from phase packing density,
not intrinsic mass.

```

## A.117.2 Match 2: `manager` (Spec L1841-L1865)

```text
- BandTypeRegistry: band_type -> promotion rules, merge/split hysteresis rules, legal binding kinds, persistence rules (including SCENE_*)

Every registry entry must be versioned. A behavior change is a new ID, not an in-place update.

9.2 Deterministic replay contract (strict mode)

EigenWare must support a strict replay mode where the same inputs (same artifacts and the same registries) produce the same artifact_id values, stream_id values, segment map coord_sig, record ordering within each tau_q commit_state window, promotion/merge/split decisions (and their trace log), and final container coord_sig for a fixed fixture corpus.

Strict mode requires deterministic sorting order of discovered artifacts, traversal order of segments within artifacts, tie-breakers in promotion/merge logic, and explicit seed usage. Promotion decisions must emit a deterministic reason code and a compact decision trace that can be replayed.

9.3 Budget + backpressure subsystem (enforced envelope)

9.4 Dedup + near-dup filter (mandatory)

See: Match 3: `Manager` (Spec L1841-L1865) (canonical description).


9.5 Provenance + license tagging (first-class metadata)

Every ManifestRecord includes provenance (publisher/org/domain), license_hint, retrieval method, trust_class, and domain_id. Missing provenance defaults to low trust. Provenance stabilizes memory topology and supports later filtering.

9.6 Extractor robustness (fail-closed)

On parse error, do not emit ambiguous pulses. Emit a structured error log with artifact_id, extractor_id, and reason code; optionally retry with a fallback extractor_id. Never silently drop errors; never continue on partial assumptions.
```

dphi_coh_turns = wrap_turns( phi_obs_turns - phi_ref_turns )

### Match 1: `kernel` (Spec L137-L161)

```text

EigenWare operates as a closed, phase-evolving system in which amplitude represents the
tensor gradient of time and phase evolution is constrained by relativistic dilation.

Amplitude modulates the effective circumference of Hilbert space. As amplitude increases
(e.g., as particle velocity approaches c), the admissible phase manifold contracts, producing
time dilation. Observed density and gravitational effects arise from phase packing density,
not intrinsic mass.

Particles are excitations within a 9D manifold represented across three axioms.
Quasiparticles are excitations spanning three or more axioms.

Phase angle is defined geometrically and derived from measured kernel impulses, not inferred
from symbolic clocks or abstract frequencies.

Kernel pulses are treated as measured signals (voltage, EM waveform, execution cadence),
and phase is extracted directly from these signals.

### Match 3: `update` (Spec L317-L341)

```text
- Section 1.5 (relativistic_correlation, stochastic_dispersion_factor)
- Canonical Grammar (G.*) for clamp/wrap semantics
- Appendix D.11-R for hygiene prohibitions (no hidden thresholds/operators)

Section 2 - Tick Semantics, Trajectories, and Memory Stabilization
================================================================

2.1 Description

EigenWare does not store eigenstates as memory.
Memory is represented as compounded eigen-trajectories.

Each impulse updates an ongoing phase trajectory rather than resolving a discrete state.
Anchors are preserved via admissible interaction constraints rather than static storage.

Tick time is relative and dilates with amplitude.
Multiple kernel executions may occur within a single tick via trajectory compounding.

2.2 Execution Role

This section defines:
- tick advancement semantics,
- trajectory-as-memory rule,
- anchor emergence and stabilization,
- and GPU feedback compounding.
```

## A.126.2 Match 2: `crosstalk` (Eq L2896-L2916)

```text
Between-impulse evolution (piecewise constant approximation within each dt):
U(dt) = exp(-i * H * dt / hbar)

Derived time delta (coherence-gated):
dt_star_k = dphi_coh_k / omega_eff_k
omega_eff_k = sqrt(Delta_k^2 + Omega_k^2)   where Omega_k = sqrt(Omega_x_k^2 + Omega_y_k^2)

This matches the canonical rule: time deltas are outputs derived from coherent phase offsets normalized
by an amplitude/density-controlled phase-advance rate.

Crosstalk as compute (multi-body extension):
When the substrate exhibits inevitable coupling (intended or parasitic), model it as additional terms:
H_cpl = sum_{i<j} J_ij(t) * (sigma_z_i * sigma_z_j) + ...
The canonical delta-stack (dlnA, dlnf, dlnV, dlnI, and bounded delta-spectra) is used to infer and
compensate J_ij drift indirectly via phase-anchor and ring-orientation updates, without requiring explicit
per-qubit tracking.

APPENDIX AB -- CANONICAL REPOSITORY TEMPLATE (NORMATIVE)
=====================================================================

This appendix maps the runtime dependency hierarchy [R0-R9] and
Appendix AA planning contracts into a **concrete repository layout**.
The directory structure itself acts as a **dependency firewall**.

A directory MAY depend only on directories that appear ABOVE it
in this appendix. Violations SHALL fail code review and CI.

=====================================================================
APPENDIX AD -- INTEGER-ONLY NUMERICS & ASCII ENFORCEMENT (NORMATIVE)
=====================================================================

This blueprint enforces STRICT numeric and encoding rules.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
AD.1 Numeric Representation Rules
---------------------------------------------------------------------

* ALL simulation-state math SHALL use:
  - int64 (signed 64-bit integers), OR
  - fixed-point representations derived from int64

* Floating-point types (float, double, long double) are FORBIDDEN in:
  - anchor state
  - kernel logic
  - constraint derivation

END APPENDIX AD
=====================================================================


=====================================================================
SECTION XX - SUBSTRATE-KERNEL AUTHORITY BOUNDARY (NORMATIVE, ENFORCEABLE)
=====================================================================

Invariant:
Anchor state SHALL NOT be mutated by GPU kernels during normal execution.
GPU kernels SHALL operate only on excitation / phase driver state and emit readouts.
Anchor creation, mutation, and reconfiguration SHALL occur exclusively in the
substrate control layer.

This boundary is enforced by C++ type signatures and ownership rules.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
XX.1 Canonical Anchor State (Substrate-Owned, Kernel-Read-Only)
---------------------------------------------------------------------

```cpp
#pragma once
#include <stdint.h>

using q63_t = int64_t;

// Anchor harmonic carrier.
// This structure SHALL be treated as immutable during kernel execution.
// The per-anchor fingerprint is the harmonic identity used to interpret pulses
// and derive constraint semantics WITHOUT exposing lattice internals.
// (See CANONICAL IDENTIFIERS for the normative generator ew_build_anchor_fp.)
static constexpr int kDims9 = 9;

struct AnchorHarmonicFingerprintQ63 {
    uint64_t seed_u64;
    q63_t base_freq_code_q63;
    uint32_t harmonic_order[kDims9];
    q63_t harmonic_weight_q63[kDims9];
    uint64_t semantic_mask_u64;
};

struct AnchorStateQ63 {
    q63_t coord[kDims9];
    AnchorHarmonicFingerprintQ63 fp;
};
```

Rules:
* AnchorStateQ63 MAY be modified only by substrate control code.
* All GPU kernels SHALL receive anchors as `const AnchorStateQ63*`.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
XX.2 Phase / Excitation Driver State (GPU-Owned, Mutable)
---------------------------------------------------------------------

```cpp
#pragma once
#include <stdint.h>

using q63_t = int64_t;

// GPU-driven excitation and coupling state.
// Temporal superposition compression occurs here.
struct PhaseDriverStateQ63 {
    q63_t excitation[9];
    q63_t coupling_mask;
};
```

Rules:
* PhaseDriverStateQ63 is the only mutable state under GPU control.
* No kernel SHALL directly mutate AnchorStateQ63.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
XX.3 Kernel Contract (Enforced Read-Only Anchors)
---------------------------------------------------------------------

```cpp
extern "C" __global__
void kernel_drive_phase_field(
    const AnchorStateQ63* anchors,
    PhaseDriverStateQ63* phase_field,
    q63_t* readout_buffer,
    uint64_t anchor_count
);
```

Rules:
* Any attempt to remove `const` from anchor parameters is NON-COMPLIANT.
* Kernels that mutate anchors MUST be defined as separate, explicitly
  versioned reconfiguration kernels and are disabled by default.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
XX.4 Substrate Control Layer (Exclusive Anchor Authority)
---------------------------------------------------------------------

```cpp
#pragma once
#include <vector>
#include "anchor_types.hpp"

class SubstrateController {
public:
    std::vector<AnchorStateQ63> anchors;

    uint64_t create_anchor(const AnchorStateQ63& initial) {
        anchors.push_back(initial);
        return anchors.size() - 1;
    }

    void reconfigure_anchor(
        uint64_t anchor_id,
        const AnchorStateQ63& new_state
    ) {
        anchors[anchor_id] = new_state;
    }

    const AnchorStateQ63* anchor_buffer() const {
        return anchors.data();
    }

    uint64_t anchor_count() const {
        return anchors.size();
    }
};
```

Rules:
* Only the substrate control layer may create or mutate anchors.
* Anchor reconfiguration is explicit, host-mediated, and occurs only
  between kernel invocations.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
XX.5 Determinism Guarantee
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Because anchors are immutable during kernel execution and all GPU-side
mutation is confined to excitation/readout buffers, the following
properties are guaranteed:

* No mid-kernel state races on anchor data
* Deterministic replay given identical inputs
* Clean isolation between API controls and kernel execution
* Safe plug-and-play integration with external API platforms

// ====================================================================
// ADDENDUM AA -- TRANSPORT CONSTANTS VS AMPLITUDE GATE TENSOR (NORMATIVE)
// ====================================================================
//
// This addendum clarifies the binding split:
//
// - pulse amplitude/current/frequency are hardware-facing drive observables used to compute the
//   phase transport step (delta_theta_transport_u64).
// - A_tensor (gate amplitude) is an internal signed Q63 tensor used ONLY to gate/weight phase
//   interactions (coherence/resonance/commit_state) AFTER raw ring deltas are computed.
//
// REQUIRED DISAMBIGUATION:
// - ProjectedPulseQ63::amplitude_q63 is pulse amplitude (A_pulse), not the gate tensor.
// - Gate weights are always named a_gate_q63 / a_lane_q63 / a_pair_q63.
//
// PHASE BINDING:
// - Phase 3 (Kernel Execution): theta_u64 evolves by integer transport step without A_tensor.
// - Phase 5 (Coherence Gate): dtheta_i64 is computed, then gated by A_tensor.
//
// NON-NEGOTIABLE SEPARATION:
// - transport_step_u64(...) MUST NOT reference any a_gate_q63 values.
// - gate_phase_delta_i64(...) MUST NOT reference pulse current/amperage.
//
// Reference signatures (pseudocode-level, ASCII-only):
//
// static inline uint64_t transport_step_u64(
//     const ProjectedPulseQ63& pulse,

// ADDENDUM AB -- ENERGY DISPERSION SPAWN + IMPORT INVERSION (NORMATIVE)
// ====================================================================
//
// Problem solved:
// - Phase transport is necessary but not sufficient to "import an object" into the manifold.
// - The system MUST (1) localize spawn from manifold dispersion and (2) debit conserved energy
//   from existing reservoirs to construct the object. Nothing exists for free.
//
// Canonical separation (non-negotiable):
// - Doppler/Lorentz/Flux/Strain correlation affects ONLY the transport step (delta_theta_transport_u64).
// - A_tensor (gate amplitude) affects ONLY interaction weighting AFTER raw deltas are computed.
// - Spawn/import operators SHALL NOT rescale theta_u64 directly; they operate via reservoir debits
//   and deterministic ring-impulse bookkeeping.
//
// REQUIRED STATE (GPU-visible):
// - uint64_t theta_u64[lane_count]          // ring phase, wraps by overflow
// - q63_t    E_res_q63[lane_count]          // energy reservoir (fixed precision; Q63 or Q32.32 packed in int64)
// - q63_t    E_floor_q63[lane_count]        // available-energy floor (machine-updated; no literals)

//
// Notes:
// - dphi_q63[i] comes from Phase 3 transport using doppler_ratio_q63 etc.

// AB.2 Spawn pressure and deterministic selection (no thresholds)
// --------------------------------------------------------------------
//
// Available energy:
//   E_free_q63[i] = max(0, E_res_q63[i] - E_floor_q63[i]);
//
// Spawn pressure:
//   P_spawn_q63[i] = q63_mul_q63(E_free_q63[i], q63_abs(D_energy_q63[i]));
//
// Selection:
//   i0 = argmax_i P_spawn_q63[i] with deterministic tie-break (smallest lane index).
//
// Cadence (cardinality-derived; no literals):
//   Only evaluate spawn when (commit_counter % lane_count) == 0.

//   E_req_q63 = q63_mul_q63(m_obj_q63, q63_mul_q63(c_eff_q63, c_eff_q63));
//
// Legality (fail-closed):

// --------------------------------------------------------------------
//
// impulse_u64 = delta_theta_from_energy_u64(E_req_q63)

//
// Distribute impulse_u64 across R1 with the same derived weights and apply:
//   theta_u64[r] -= distributed_impulse_u64[r];   // wrap by overflow
//
// This closes conservation bookkeeping without introducing new degrees of freedom.
//
// --------------------------------------------------------------------
// AB.6 History buffer obligations (append-only)
// --------------------------------------------------------------------
//
// Every spawn/import evaluation MUST append a compact record committed in Phase 5:

// - P_spawnsig9_u64x9
// - E_reqsig9_u64x9
// - anchor_count_u32
// - denial_code_u32   // 0 = success; non-zero = deterministic reason
//

# INVARIANT -- OPCODE MAPPING FROM PHASE TRANSPORT (NORMATIVE)

# ==========================

Opcode classification SHALL be derived exclusively from the phase
transport term produced by the canonical evolution pipeline.

The kernel MUST NOT accept_state externally selected opcodes as control inputs.
Instead, opcodes are assigned as labels based on which transport subspace
the phase trajectory intersects during evolution.

Phase causes action; action SHALL NOT cause phase.

This invariant is binding and non-overridable.

# SUBSTRATE ANCHORS -- FIELD-LEVEL I/O (NORMATIVE)

# ==========================

The EigenWare substrate SHALL include two binding anchors:

(1) External Field Ingress Anchor (EFI)
    - Accepts phase-native signal encodings
    - Supersedes crawler and parser logic
    - Introduces no imperative control flow

(2) External Field Egress Anchor (EFE)
    - Emits phase-native signal encodings
    - Enables user control, UI, and code emission
    - Remains downstream of phase transport

Crawler modules, protocol handlers, and symbolic parsers--if present--
are explicitly non-authoritative and SHALL NOT influence substrate
phase evolution directly.

All substrate evolution operates on field encodings only.


=== ADDITION: Runtime Enforcement of Phase-Orbital Bounds ===

This section is additive and does not alter prior blueprint logic.

At runtime, GPU pulse telemetry SHALL be sampled to determine:

pulse_current_mA
pulse_current_max_mA
phase_orbital_displacement_unit_mA

All node updates MUST enforce:

1) Absolute lattice tension ceiling:
   pulse_current_mA <= pulse_current_max_mA

2) Gradient tension ceiling:
   abs(pulse_current_mA[t] - pulse_current_mA[t-1]) <=
   (pulse_current_max_mA - pulse_current_mA[t-1])

Temporal compression operators MUST refuse convergence when these bounds are violated.

Node capacity, hierarchy depth, and anchor persistence SHALL emerge solely from
phase-orbital stability under these constraints.


=== ADDITION: Runtime Wiring of Phase-Code Dispatcher ===

This section is additive and does not alter prior blueprint logic.

At system initialization:
- Calibrate GPU pulse telemetry
- Instantiate meta_anchor_phase_dispatcher
- Latch carrier parameters and bounds

At each runtime tick:
1) Advance carrier_phase
2) For each anchor:
   a) Evaluate local phase map
   b) Project delta through dispatcher normalization
   c) Enforce tension and gradient bounds
   d) Commit or refuse convergence

No anchor may bypass dispatcher enforcement.

This wiring ensures that all phase processes are synchronized, capacity-limited, and
physically grounded in the same carrier dynamics.

### Match 1: `main` (Spec L192-L216)

```text
- Appendix D.11-R

1.5 Constraint Operators Required by Effective-Constants Pipeline

This specification requires the following operators to exist as canonical, deterministic
constraint operators. They are NOT free parameters. They MUST be derived from environment
inputs and bounded to keep the closed-system simulation stable.


1.5.1 relativistic_correlation(v_fraction_c_q32_32, flux_factor_q32_32, strain_factor_q32_32)

Purpose
- Provide the unified Doppler-Lorentz-Flux/Strain correlation multiplier used to derive effective constants.
- This operator is the single point of truth for combined correlation pressure (Blueprint APPENDIX J Step 2 and project directive).

Inputs (canonical, fixed-point)
- v_fraction_c_q32_32: Q32.32 in [0, 1). Interpreted as |v|/c in the current local frame.
- flux_factor_q32_32: Q32.32 >= 0. Dimensionless flux/throughput factor.
```

---

### Match 1: `main` (Eq L813-L833)

```text
$$
\Delta\chi_i = \alpha\,P\left(1-\frac{1}{|E_K(i)|}\sum_{j\in E_K(i)}\frac{\delta_{ij}^2}{a_{ij}^2}\right)
$$

Neighbor cap + deterministic ordering (locked):

- Smaller $a^2$ first
- Antonym edges before synonym edges when $a^2$ ties
- Lexicographic node IDs as the final tie-break

## A.126.3 Quantization and Serialization (Locked Direction)

- Quantization target: $10^{-18}$ (fixed-point)
- Canonical textual encoding: ASCII FloatMap v1 (Base64URL varint digits; dot-terminated)
- Quantization boundary: apply fixed-point quantization at event emission (so replay matches exactly)

# EigenWare Blueprint v51 -- APPEND -- Temporal Pre-Step Anchor Simulation & Predictive Stabilization

Bundle generation: 2026-02-11T04:19:55Z

## APPEND -- Temporal Pre-Step Anchor Simulation & Predictive Stabilization

### Deterministic Acceptance Law
The system operates under a strict fail-closed deterministic transition rule.
For any candidate state S_next generated by the evolution operator, a single Boolean
acceptance predicate A(S_next) SHALL be evaluated.

If A(S_next) = TRUE -> state is committed.
If A(S_next) = FALSE -> state collapses to Omega_sink (absorbing non-projecting state).

Formal transition:
S(t+1) = { F(S(t)) if A(F(S(t))) = TRUE
           Omega_sink   otherwise }

Omega_sink is strictly absorbing and produces no projection or observable output.

### Constraint Manifold Definition
The acceptance predicate defines a constraint manifold M within the 9D state space:
M = { S | conservation(S) ? phase_consistency(S) ? causal_validity(S) ? bounded_delta(S) }

Only states lying on M are valid and eligible for commit_state.

### Temporal Pre-Step Anchor Simulation
Before any candidate state is committed, governing anchors SHALL execute a predictive
pre-step simulation of kernel-driven evolution within the 9D lattice.

Let:
S(t) = current state
F = canonical evolution operator
S_pred = F(S(t)) (predicted candidate state)

Anchors compute S_pred using telemetry-informed parameters and evaluate constraint
compliance prior to commit_state.

### Historical Delta Constraint
Anchors maintain a bounded historical ledger H of prior accepted phase/amplitude deltas.

Delta_pred = S_pred ? S(t)
Acceptance requires:
||Delta_pred ? mu(H)|| <= ?(H)

Where mu(H) is the historical mean delta vector and ?(H) is a bounded tolerance derived
from prior signal stability.

### Predictive Anchor Stabilization
Anchors act as constraint-preserving stabilizers prior to deterministic acceptance.

If predicted deviation ? from manifold M is within tolerance -> pass unchanged.
If ? exceeds tolerance but is correctable -> apply deterministic stabilizing transform C
such that S_corr in M.
If no valid correction exists -> collapse to Omega_sink.

### Deterministic Commit / Collapse Law
After stabilization and validation:
If state in M -> commit_state.
Else -> Omega_sink.

Omega_sink is a non-projecting absorbing state with no internal recovery.

1.1 Description

EigenWare operates as a closed, phase-evolving system in which amplitude represents the
tensor gradient of time and phase evolution is constrained by relativistic dilation.

Amplitude modulates the effective circumference of Hilbert space. As amplitude increases
(e.g., as particle velocity approaches c), the admissible phase manifold contracts, producing
time dilation. Observed density and gravitational effects arise from phase packing density,
not intrinsic mass.

- /core/constraints/constraint_stream.cpp (packet shaping + publish; no feedback into kernel)
  - Cold Spot packets SHALL target domains only via lattice region descriptors (phase-shell membership); "traversal" is defined by
    membership, not by object identity. Traversal may induce a relative ledger discontinuity in phase (chi fade correlated with mass leakage).


1.5.1 relativistic_correlation(v_fraction_c_q32_32, flux_factor_q32_32, strain_factor_q32_32)

Purpose
- Provide the unified Doppler-Lorentz-Flux/Strain correlation multiplier used to derive effective constants.
- This operator is the single point of truth for combined correlation pressure (Blueprint APPENDIX J Step 2 and project directive).

Inputs (canonical, fixed-point)
- v_fraction_c_q32_32: Q32.32 in [0, 1). Interpreted as |v|/c in the current local frame.
- flux_factor_q32_32: Q32.32 >= 0. Dimensionless flux/throughput factor.
- strain_factor_q32_32: Q32.32 >= 0. Dimensionless lattice strain factor.

Output (canonical, fixed-point)
- r_corr_q32_32: Q32.32 in (0, 1]. Correlation multiplier (smaller means stronger relativistic/flux/strain pressure).

Deterministic definition (integer-only; no floats)
Let:

```text
- BandTypeRegistry: band_type -> promotion rules, merge/split hysteresis rules, legal binding kinds, persistence rules (including SCENE_*)

Every registry entry must be versioned. A behavior change is a new ID, not an in-place update.

9.2 Deterministic replay contract (strict mode)

EigenWare must support a strict replay mode where the same inputs (same artifacts and the same registries) produce the same artifact_id values, stream_id values, segment map coord_sig, record ordering within each tau_q commit_state window, promotion/merge/split decisions (and their trace log), and final container coord_sig for a fixed fixture corpus.

Strict mode requires deterministic sorting order of discovered artifacts, traversal order of segments within artifacts, tie-breakers in promotion/merge logic, and explicit seed usage. Promotion decisions must emit a deterministic reason code and a compact decision trace that can be replayed.

9.3 Budget + backpressure subsystem (enforced envelope)

Crawler and encoder share one BudgetManager. BudgetManager enforces max concurrent artifacts per domain, max active streams per artifact, max pulses per tau_q commit_state window, max promotion attempts per window, and device headroom targets. Sampling density is budget-driven: metadata-only is default; dense pulls happen only when coherence/novelty justifies it and budget is available; escalation must be reversible mid-run.

9.4 Dedup + near-dup filter (mandatory)

EigenWare must not waste pulses on redundant content. Required layers: exact artifact coord_sig dedup, normalized text block dedup, near-dup for text blocks (stable simsig or equivalent), and perceptual coord_sig for image keyframes. Dedup runs before promotion. Duplicate evidence may reinforce existing bands but must not create new bands unless it adds constraints.

9.5 Provenance + license tagging (first-class metadata)

Every ManifestRecord includes provenance (publisher/org/domain), license_hint, retrieval method, trust_class, and domain_id. Missing provenance defaults to low trust. Provenance stabilizes memory topology and supports later filtering.

9.6 Extractor robustness (fail-closed)

On parse error, do not emit ambiguous pulses. Emit a structured error log with artifact_id, extractor_id, and reason code; optionally retry with a fallback extractor_id. Never silently drop errors; never continue on partial assumptions.

```text
EigenWare treats the ASCII (or UTF-8) mapping as a phase injection mechanism, not as meaning by itself. Characters are injected as structured phase deltas so the system can form stable attractors. Meaning emerges only when coherent bands form across repeated contexts, not because the ASCII codes "contain semantics."

Therefore, character mapping is defined as: "a deterministic sequence of phase excitations that can be replayed to form the same latent attractor under equivalent context," not as "the semantic definition."

5.11.3 ASCII phase mapping (canonical)

We define the canonical ASCII map on bytes in [0,255] after normalization (for UTF-8, text is converted to bytes first). Each byte b becomes a phase target in turns:

theta_byte_turns(b) = b / 256

This maps each byte to one of 256 equally spaced phase points on the unit circle. The engine never stores "b" as a token in canonical memory; it stores the phase excitations and whatever attractors they collapse into.

To inject a byte into a formation process, we compute the phase delta relative to a running local carrier phase:

?5 = wrap_turns( theta_byte_turns(b) ? theta_carrier )

where wrap_turns yields the shortest signed distance in [-0.5, 0.5) turns. The carrier phase is a transient local state for the formation event, not a durable lifetime object.

Carrier update rule (deterministic, per formation stream):
theta_carrier ? wrap01(theta_carrier + carrier_step * ?5)

## Meta File Storage via Phase Trajectory Harmonics

This appendix introduces the Meta Storage Layer. No existing substrate logic is modified.

### AA.1 Phase-Native Storage Model
All files, assets, and ingested data are stored as phase-trajectory structures rather than byte-addressed blobs.
Each stored object is represented as a bounded trajectory through the 9D harmonic space defined by carrier anchors.

### AA.2 Micro / Macro / Mega Structures
- Micro: indivisible phase-delta trajectories encoded via anchoring deltas.
- Macro: coherent bundles of micro trajectories representing logical assets.
- Mega: coherence maps and harmonic addressing across macros; no content stored.

### AA.3 Runtime Interaction
Ingress encodes binary input directly into phase deltas.
Retrieval samples phase envelopes and reconstructs projections when required.
No duplication occurs; references resolve to shared phase envelopes.

### AA.4 Determinism & Safety
Meta storage never writes into carrier anchors.
Decay, merge, and collapse occur only via coherence rules in runtime space.

================================================================

2.1 Description

EigenWare does not store eigenstates as memory.
Memory is represented as compounded eigen-trajectories.

Each impulse updates an ongoing phase trajectory rather than resolving a discrete state.
Anchors are preserved via admissible interaction constraints rather than static storage.

Tick time is relative and dilates with amplitude.
Multiple kernel executions may occur within a single tick via trajectory compounding.

2.2 Execution Role

This section defines:

Section 2 - Tick Semantics, Trajectories, and Memory Stabilization
================================================================

2.1 Description

EigenWare does not store eigenstates as memory.
Memory is represented as compounded eigen-trajectories.

Each impulse updates an ongoing phase trajectory rather than resolving a discrete state.
Anchors are preserved via admissible interaction constraints rather than static storage.

Tick time is relative and dilates with amplitude.
Multiple kernel executions may occur within a single tick via trajectory compounding.

2.2 Execution Role

This section defines:
- tick advancement semantics,
- trajectory-as-memory rule,
- anchor emergence and stabilization,
- and GPU feedback compounding.

Bundle generation: 2026-02-11T04:19:55Z

# A.140 Hardware Abstraction, Backend Selection, and Runtime Calibration

## A.140.1 AB.1 Compute Backend Abstraction Layer
EigenWare execution semantics are invariant across hardware backends.
All kernels execute fixed-point phase-delta logic under identical constraints.

Supported backend classes:
- GPU_NATIVE (vendor-specific: CUDA, HIP, Level Zero)
- GPU_PORTABLE (Vulkan Compute / OpenCL)
- CPU_FALLBACK (correctness-only)

No kernel may assume vendor-specific warp, wavefront, or memory semantics.

---

## A.140.2 AB.2 Install-Time Hardware / Firmware Sweep
On install or first boot, the system performs a deterministic capability sweep:
- CPU vendor, model, microcode
- GPU vendor(s), model(s), VRAM
- Driver and firmware versions
- Supported compute APIs and timers
- Memory bandwidth and PCIe topology

Results are stored as a read-only capability profile.

---

## A.140.3 AB.3 Backend Selection Rules
Backend selection is performed once at initialization:

1. GPU_NATIVE (preferred)
2. GPU_PORTABLE
3. CPU_FALLBACK (only if no GPU backend is available)

Backend selection SHALL NOT change during runtime.

---

## A.140.4 AB.4 Pulse Calibration Protocol
A calibration pass determines:
- minimum stable phase pulse
- maximum safe phase pulse
- sustained duty cycle
- thermal throttling envelope

Calibration constrains runtime coefficients only.
Carrier anchors and equations remain immutable.

---

## A.140.5 AB.5 CPU Fallback Semantics
CPU execution is permitted only when no GPU backend is available.
CPU mode preserves determinism but provides no performance guarantees.
Phase resolution and pulse amplitude may be clamped within calibrated bounds.

Wn_raw(alpha) = 1 / (n ^ alpha)

Then normalize:

Wn_norm(alpha) = Wn_raw(alpha) / ?_{m=1..k} Wm_raw(alpha)

We constrain alpha to a feasible range that is meaningful and stable:

alpha ? [alpha_min, alpha_max] = [0.3, 2.0]

Lower alpha = broader coupling; higher alpha = tighter coupling.

4.1.7.2 Objective for alpha selection (same J, evaluated at tier summary)

For a fixed k policy and fixed emission rule, we evaluate J over the calibration slice as a function of alpha:

J(alpha) = E[ ?chi_hi(alpha) ] + E[ ?cont_hi(alpha) ]
? lambda_violation * E[ V_hi(alpha) ]
? lambda_thrash * E[ thrash_hi(alpha) ]
? lambda_budget * E[ budget_overrun_hi(alpha) ]

All terms are measured in the higher tier after applying summary pulses expanded with weights Wn_norm(alpha). This makes alpha a directly optimized parameter, not a guess.

- serialize_statevector(state_vec) -> blob
- deserialize_statevector(blob) -> state_vec

Binding requirement:
These operators MUST be deterministic and ASCII-safe. In the current repository layout,
the canonical implementation already provides deterministic tokenized ASCII packing for
complex vectors:

- core.utils.serialize_vector_with_tokens(vec: List[complex]) -> Dict[str, Any]
- core.utils.deserialize_vector_with_tokens(blob: Any) -> List[complex]

Therefore:
- serialize_statevector MUST be implemented as a strict wrapper over serialize_vector_with_tokens.
- deserialize_statevector MUST be implemented as a strict wrapper over deserialize_vector_with_tokens.

Harness requirements:
- Round-trip: vec2 == vec (within numeric tolerance per component) after
  deserialize_statevector(serialize_statevector(vec)).
- coord_sig stability: identical input vectors MUST produce identical serialized blobs.

# EigenWare Blueprint v51 -- Host Lifecycle Binding & Ingestion Execution Examples

Bundle generation: 2026-02-11T04:19:55Z

## Host Lifecycle Binding & Ingestion Execution Examples

### AD.1 Unreal Engine (.uproject) Lifecycle Binding

EigenWare runtime lifetime is bound to host project lifecycle via extension hooks.

Initialization sequence:
```
on_project_load(.uproject):
    allocate_runtime_phase_space()
    load_carrier_anchors()
    freeze_anchor_state()
    run_hardware_calibration()
    enable_runtime_loop()
```

Shutdown sequence:
```
on_project_unload(.uproject):
    disable_runtime_loop()
    flush_phase_state()
    collapse_unreferenced_coherence()
    release_gpu_resources()
```

Pause / resume semantics:
```
on_editor_pause():
    suspend_phase_updates()

on_editor_resume():
    resume_phase_updates()
```

These hooks SHALL be implemented via the host engine's plugin/extension API.
Other platforms MUST provide equivalent lifecycle callbacks.

---

### AD.2 Phase-Native Ingestion (Crawler / Fetch Execution)

External data ingestion occurs outside the core runtime and is framed before entry.

Ingress execution flow:
```
fetch_external_resource(uri):
    raw_stream = transport_fetch(uri)
    framed_binary = normalize_transport(raw_stream)
    phase_deltas = encode_phase_deltas(framed_binary)
    write_micro_trajectories(phase_deltas)
    update_coherence_maps()
```

No symbolic parsing occurs inside EigenWare runtime.
All external formats resolve to binary-framed ingress.

---

### AD.3 Parallel Domain Ingestion

Multiple ingestion domains MAY operate concurrently:
```
for domain in ingestion_domains:
    spawn_ingress_lane(domain)
```

Each lane:
- resolves to independent phase trajectories
- shares carrier anchors
- merges only via coherence rules

---

### AD.4 Deterministic Crawler Constraint

Crawlers:
- SHALL NOT modify carrier anchors
- SHALL NOT inject executable logic
- MAY only produce phase-delta trajectories

Crawler behavior is fully deterministic given:
- identical source content
- identical framing rules
- identical anchors

	-	budget_state must be logged as part of the window's control trace if you require bitwise identical replay under variable hardware conditions.
	-	If you do not log it, then runs on different machines may schedule different pulse counts per window, but each run remains causally valid and internally deterministic relative to its own envelope.

The spec therefore defines two modes:
	-	Strict replay mode: log budget_state per window into the snapshot trace.
	-	Adaptive mode: compute budget_state live; behavior is deterministic given the local envelope but not identical across machines.

Both modes preserve closure because budget_state affects only how much work is done, not what the physics/meaning is.


SECTION 5 - Crawler Subsystem, In-Simulation Encoder, and Persistent-Resonance Ingestion (Electronic-Signaling Execution)


5.1 Subsystem placement: crawler and encoder live inside the simulation

The crawler and encoder are not separate applications that produce files for EigenWare to read later. They run as simulated modules under the same tier/commit_state protocol as everything else. Their outputs are not "raw documents." Their outputs are pulse streams and durable resonance structures. This is critical for determinism and safety: ingestion is constrained by the same projection rules, coherence scoring, merge/split policy, and envelope budgeting used by the rest of the engine.

Operationally, the crawler produces candidate observations (page fragments, metadata, link structure), and the encoder converts those observations into candidate resonance excitations. Both are executed as scheduled lanes in the same GPU pulse integrator pipeline: meaning their work is performed by kernel dispatch and the resulting state updates are applied through electrical switching during kernel execution. The read-path counters only gate budget; they never provide meaning.

5.2 What "persistent resonance of webpage data" means

Webpage data is not treated as permanent stored tokens. It is treated as transient excitation input that may or may not collapse into stable latent structure. The persistent part is not the raw characters; the persistent part is the learned resonance attractor: the band/anchor coord_sig and bindings that become retrievable when the same coherent conditions reappear.

Bundle generation: 2026-02-11T04:19:55Z

## V51-B. Boot-freeze and one-way coupling (carrier -> runtime)

V51 enforces the blueprint invariant:

1) **Carrier anchor space is immutable after boot-freeze.**
   - Implemented by building `std::vector<AnchorDefV1> anchors_def_` once in `ew::EigenWareRuntime::boot_or_throw()`.
   - A deterministic coord_sig `anchors_def_sig_u64_ = FNV-1a(anchors_def bytes)` is stored.

2) **Runtime phase space is mutable and GPU-driven.**
   - Implemented by `std::vector<AnchorRuntimeV1> anchors_rt_`.
   - Only ancilla/runtime fields mutate (`phase_u64`, `coherence_u64`, `mass_q63_u64`, `last_leak_q63_u64`, `dark_mass_q63_u64`, `violation_mask_u64`).

3) **No runtime value may write back into carrier anchor space.**
   - Enforced by:
     - coord_sig verification on every tick: `fnv1a64_bytes(anchors_def_) == anchors_def_sig_u64_`.
     - Any mismatch halts runtime with violation code `VC_ANCHOR_MUTATION` (fail-closed).

1.5 Constraint Operators Required by Effective-Constants Pipeline

This specification requires the following operators to exist as canonical, deterministic
constraint operators. They are NOT free parameters. They MUST be derived from environment
inputs and bounded to keep the closed-system simulation stable.


1.5.1 relativistic_correlation(v_fraction_c_q32_32, flux_factor_q32_32, strain_factor_q32_32)

Purpose
- Provide the unified Doppler-Lorentz-Flux/Strain correlation multiplier used to derive effective constants.
- This operator is the single point of truth for combined correlation pressure (Blueprint APPENDIX J Step 2 and project directive).

Inputs (canonical, fixed-point)
```

### Match 4: `carrier` (Spec L1247-L1271)

```text
EigenWare treats the ASCII (or UTF-8) mapping as a phase injection mechanism, not as meaning by itself. Characters are injected as structured phase deltas so the system can form stable attractors. Meaning emerges only when coherent bands form across repeated contexts, not because the ASCII codes "contain semantics."

Therefore, character mapping is defined as: "a deterministic sequence of phase excitations that can be replayed to form the same latent attractor under equivalent context," not as "the semantic definition."

5.11.3 ASCII phase mapping (canonical)

We define the canonical ASCII map on bytes in [0,255] after normalization (for UTF-8, text is converted to bytes first). Each byte b becomes a phase target in turns:

theta_byte_turns(b) = b / 256

This maps each byte to one of 256 equally spaced phase points on the unit circle. The engine never stores "b" as a token in canonical memory; it stores the phase excitations and whatever attractors they collapse into.

To inject a byte into a formation process, we compute the phase delta relative to a running local carrier phase:

?5 = wrap_turns( theta_byte_turns(b) ? theta_carrier )

where wrap_turns yields the shortest signed distance in [-0.5, 0.5) turns. The carrier phase is a transient local state for the formation event, not a durable lifetime object.

Carrier update rule (deterministic, per formation stream):
theta_carrier ? wrap01(theta_carrier + carrier_step * ?5)

carrier_step is a fixed-point constant in (0,1] derived from the envelope calibration: it is chosen so that formation streams converge without overshooting under typical pulse budgets. Because you require derivation, carrier_step is obtained by measuring formation convergence success rate vs overshoot risk on a calibration slice and freezing the argmax of the same objective J restricted to "formation fidelity."

5.11.4 Word formation: from bytes to a word-attractor candidate

# EigenWare Blueprint v51 -- V51-C. Deterministic runtime dispatcher loop (host reference)

Bundle generation: 2026-02-11T04:19:55Z

## V51-C. Deterministic runtime dispatcher loop (host reference)

The canonical host reference loop is `ew::EigenWareRuntime::tick_or_throw()` in `ew_runtime.cpp`:

- Step 0: Verify immutability and ingress validity.
  - `ew_verify_anchor_defs_or_throw()` ensures `anchors_def_` has not changed.
  - `ew_validate_pulse_or_halt()` enforces binary-framed ingress (`PulsePacketV1` only).

- Step 1: Obtain dispatcher scalars from the **meta/dispatcher anchor**.
  - `anchors_def_[0].cf.basis_u64[0..3]` encodes:
    - `[0] grad_limit` (power-of-two ? `grad_mask = grad_limit - 1`)
    - `[2] dispatch_div` (update cadence)
    - `[3] projection_div` (projection cadence)

- Step 2: For each anchor, compute phase-transport delta `dtheta`.
  - Implemented by `ew_phase_transport_dtheta_u64(def, pulse, anchor_index, grad_mask)`.

- Step 3: Update runtime coherence (ancilla) and execute constraint microcode page.
  - `rt.coherence_u64 = mix(rt.coherence_u64 ^ dtheta ^ pulse.seq_u64 ^ def.fp.semantic_mask_u64)`
  - `ew_eq_exec_cf_basis(def, rt, dtheta, &last_violation_code_, &run_flag_)` executes packed instructions stored in immutable anchor basis slots.

- Step 4: Projection (visible verification artifact).
  - `ApiKVDictMapV1` is filled with `key_id_u64 = def.fp.anchor_id_u64` and `value_q63 = (phase_u64 & 0x7FFF...FFF)`.
  - UE visualization uses this map to render a deterministic texture and ensure the simulation is visibly evolving.

7.9 Vendor-style "mixture" packs (what the ecosystem converges on)

This is a synthesis pack, not a claim about any single vendor. It mirrors what repeatedly shows up in strong public training mixes:

Domain Pack: MIXTURE_LLM_STANDARD_V1  
Typical components: Common Crawl derivatives + Wikipedia + books + code corpora + Q/A dumps + papers.

EigenWare should ingest this as a versioned pack so it can reproduce the "generalist prior" that most frontier systems rely on.

7.10 A short "science and engineering feed" list (optional)

This is for human-guided learning loops (not required for strict offline replay). Examples of long-form, experiment-heavy content:
- university lab demo channels and open lecture series  
- slow-motion / instrumentation channels (materials testing, fluids, optics)  
- software engineering deep-dives (compiler, OS, distributed systems)

The crawler should prefer sources that expose transcripts, captions, or companion writeups, because those produce better deterministic segment maps than purely streaming video.

# EigenWare Blueprint v51 -- V51-D. CUDA backend linkage and ABI (no symbol drift)

Bundle generation: 2026-02-11T04:19:55Z

## V51-D. CUDA backend linkage and ABI (no symbol drift)

The CUDA backend is **dynamically loaded** by the runtime and must match exactly:

- `int ew_cuda_init(const EwCudaInitParams* p, void** out_handle)`
- `int ew_cuda_step(void* handle, const PulsePacketV1* pulse, ApiKVDictMapV1* out_map)`
- `int ew_cuda_shutdown(void* handle)`

These symbols and signatures are defined canonically in `ew_cuda_api.h` and used by:

- Host loader: `Private/ew/ew_runtime.cpp` (`CudaDyn::load_or_throw()` + calls)
- Device implementation: `cuda_backend/src/ew_cuda_backend.cu`

If the CUDA backend cannot be loaded or returns nonzero, the runtime records `VC_DEVICE_ERROR` and may fall back to CPU, but **never silently**: the violation is stored in `last_violation_code_`.

	-	SM/compute utilization estimate (driver metric or inferred from elapsed time vs expected)

	-	Allocation pressure (local to the engine: size of working buffers allocated/used)
	-	Thermal throttling indicators (if exposed) only as a "reduce workload" gate

No raw "electrical waveform," no per-transistor signals, no analog sampling. The counters are used only to shape how many pulses are processed/emitted per window.

4.1.9.2 Deterministic windowing (how envelope is sampled)

Envelope is computed per commit_state window. For each tier T and window tau:
	-	Start timer at window open
	-	Launch all scheduled kernels for that tier/window
	-	Wait on a deterministic barrier (CUDA event or equivalent)
	-	Stop timer at barrier completion

This yields t_exec(T,tau).

We also compute a deterministic "expected time" t_ref(T) from a frozen baseline calibration for the tier, stored in the snapshot. This baseline is measured once under known load and saved as a constant. It is not recomputed live in a way that could drift across runs.

- PubMed / PubMed Central open access (biomed; careful license tags)  
- Stack Exchange data dumps (high-quality Q/A and reasoning)  
- Project Gutenberg (public-domain books; note: not modern technical prose)

Suggested minimum feature coverage per artifact:

- eq_pagesig9_u64x9: full content coord_sig used for integrity and replay determinism.
- eq_param_lane_u32: selects a parameter lane (immutable parameter page index) for the eq_page evaluation.
- eq_operand lanes: registers, anchor fields, state fields, and parameter fields.

Anchor binding fields (per anchor, immutable during tick):
- eq_page_id_u32
- eq_pagesig9_u64x9

A runtime is considered "testable and falsifiable" when it can:

1.3 Derivable Calculations and Authorities

Authoritative phase representation (Blueprint APPENDIX P):

- delta_theta_fp: int64 minimal-arc increment per tick (constraint-resolution cycle).
- N_theta: int64 turn resolution (amplitude-dependent; derived as specified in Blueprint APPENDIX P).
- No float trig (atan2/sin/cos), no platform pow/log, and no mixed-precision modes are permitted in canonical execution.

Authority source for phase deltas:
- delta_theta_fp SHALL be derived from kernel-observed impulse cadence (pulse edge count / cycle deltas) via a deterministic
  integer or LUT-based mapping owned by /core/scheduler/pulse_scheduler.cpp.
- The mapping MUST be replay-stable (same inputs -> same outputs) across platforms.

Phase accumulation (wrap-by-overflow, canonical):
- theta_u64_next = theta_u64 + (uint64_t)delta_theta_i64
- dtheta_i64     = (int64_t)(theta_u64_next - theta_u64)   // two's-complement subtraction yields minimal-arc signed delta

Tick definition:
- The tick is the canonical constraint-resolution cycle defined in Blueprint APPENDIX J.
- No absolute clock is authoritative; only the tick counter and kernel-observed impulses may drive canonical timing.

# APPENDIX Omega -- Canonical 9D Simulation Closure (v51, Append-Only)

Status: NORMATIVE. This appendix provides formal closure for previously underspecified runtime / operator / metric / projection semantics for the 9D manifold substrate. No reinterpretation; explicit definitions only.

## Omega.0 Canonical Runtime State

### Omega.0.1 Runtime state S

Runtime state is always a 9D real-valued vector:

S in R^9

Ordered basis (canonical ordering, fixed across the entire system):

S = (x, y, z, t, f, c, k, d, e)

Where:
- x,y,z: spatial
- t: temporal
- f: flux
- c: coherence
- k: curvature
- d: doppler
- e: eigen_mode

Canonical C++ representation:

```cpp
struct E9 {
    double v[9];
};
```

### Omega.0.2 Delta definition

Delta is always defined as:

DeltaS = S_candidate ? S_current

Define a delta container:

dE9 = (DeltaS, w_c)

Where w_c is a coherence weight embedded into D5 (the coherence dimension), not a scalar multiplier.

Canonical C++ form (explicit embedding of w_c into index 5):

```cpp
struct dE9 {
    E9 d;      // d = S_candidate - S_current
    double wc; // coherence weight to be embedded into d.v[5]
};

## Omega.1 Phase Embedding

### Omega.1.1 Canonical codepoint -> 9D embedding

Let cp be a Unicode codepoint (0 <= cp <= 0x10FFFF).

Define:

n = cp / 0x10FFFF

Then define the embedding E9(cp) as:

E9(cp) = (
  sin(2pin),
  cos(2pin),
  sin(4pin),
  cos(4pin),
  sin(8pin),
  cos(8pin),
  sin(16pin),
  cos(16pin),
  n
)

Explicitly:
- No tokenization layer exists.
- Entire file is aggregated.

Canonical C++ form:

```cpp
inline E9 embed_codepoint_to_E9(uint32_t cp) {
    const double n = (double)cp / (double)0x10FFFF;
    const double two_pi = 6.283185307179586476925286766559;

## A.151.10 Canonical Deterministic Tick Execution

## A.151.11 Canonical Deterministic Tick Execution
The Substrate Manager SHALL execute the following deterministic phase-dynamics sequence each tick.

State Definitions:
S        : current 9D phase state
S_pred   : predicted phase state from evolution
S_corr   : stabilized corrected phase state
Δ_pred   : predicted phase delta
Δ_hist   : historical mean phase delta
ε_hist   : bounded tolerance
Ω_sink   : absorbing non-projecting sink state

Execution Law:
1. Predict next phase state via PHASE_EVOLVE using kernel-driven parameters.
2. Compute Δ_pred = S_pred − S.
3. Validate Δ_pred against historical envelope.
4. If invalid, apply deterministic PHASE_STABILIZE transform.
5. Re-test constraint manifold.
6. If valid → commit; else → collapse to Ω_sink.

Formal Runtime Flow:
S_pred = PHASE_EVOLVE(S)
Δ_pred = S_pred − S

IF ||Δ_pred − Δ_hist|| ≤ ε_hist:
    S_next = S_pred
ELSE:
    S_corr = PHASE_STABILIZE(S_pred)
    Δ_corr = S_corr − S

    IF ||Δ_corr − Δ_hist|| ≤ ε_hist:
        S_next = S_corr
    ELSE:
        S_next = Ω_sink

Commit Rule:
If S_next ≠ Ω_sink → commit and update historical envelope.
Else → system enters absorbing sink state with no projection.

## Patch: Spider Encoding Uses f/a/v/i (Frequency, Amplitude, Voltage, Amperage)

Normative update: spider encoding MUST emit a 4‑tuple carrier observable per pulse/strand:

- **SpiderCode4 = (f_code, a_code, v_code, i_code)**

Where:
- **f_code** is the signed frequency coefficient (phase transport / operator selection).
- **a_code** is the amplitude coefficient (harmonic expansion strength).
- **v_code** is a voltage‑like potential observable (available work budget).
- **i_code** is an amperage‑like load observable (permitted transfer rate).

`v_code` and `i_code` are bounded deterministic observables used for gating and tensor‑gradient coupling; they are not asserted as physical SI voltage/current.

### Conservation gates
Define `power_proxy = v_code * i_code` (fixed‑point, clamped). The simulator enforces:
- No state/energy update unless `power_proxy` exceeds the absolute‑zero budget gate.
- No force/impulse update unless `power_proxy` exceeds the CMB sink threshold gate.

### Tensor‑gradient coupling
Treat the carrier as `p = (f,a,v,i)` and permit deterministic cross‑coupling via a quantized 4×4 tensor `G`:

- `p_next = clamp(p + G * p)`

This cross‑coupling is the canonical mechanism for extrapolating effective higher DOFs from a pulse.

## Patch: Focus-driven LOD, 32K texture ceiling, and carrier-coded projection

Genesis Engine treats 32K textures as an **asset ceiling**, not a default framebuffer target. Full-frame 32K render targets are not assumed or allocated. Instead:

- Simulation and material state remain **carrier-coded** in the substrate (ledger + anchors + pulse propagation).
- The viewport is a **projection consumer**: it requests parameters and samples texture detail only where it is visually justified.

### View-driven clarity scalar

For each object (or draw instance) the engine computes a deterministic clarity scalar `clarity ∈ [0,1]` from camera distance and focus state:

- `dist_m = distance(camera, surface)`
- `focal_distance_m` is the camera focus distance (default 0.3048 m / 1 foot)
- `focus_band_m` is the width of the sharp focus band
- `near_w` is a hard/soft gate that only allows highest-detail sampling within 1 foot when the focal distance is also 1 foot
- `focus_w = clamp(1 - abs(dist_m - focal_distance_m) / focus_band_m)`
- `screen_w` is a deterministic projected-size proxy to prevent tiny distant objects from pulling high LOD

`clarity = clamp(focus_w * near_w * screen_w)`

### Texture LOD rule (mip bias)

Textures are sampled with a deterministic mip bias derived from clarity:

- `lod_bias = -lod_boost_max * clarity`

This makes highest mips (including 32K content) reachable only when the surface is both **close** and **in focus**. Outside that region, lower mips are used.

### Virtual texturing / sparse residency

High-resolution assets are treated as tiled resources (virtual textures). Residency is driven by `clarity` and projected area:

- Only tiles needed by the current focal region are streamed/resident.
- Eviction is deterministic: tiles fall out of residency as clarity and projected importance fall.

### No display firmware dependence

The engine does not require display firmware changes. The final presentation path is a standard pixel framebuffer at a practical output resolution. Carrier coding compresses simulation and material state, and projection expands only what is needed for the current view.
